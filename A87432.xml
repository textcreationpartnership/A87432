            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>In the fourth Chapter, The buſineſſes ſhall be preſented, which paſt between the two Kingdoms, from the Treaty of <hi>Arras,</hi> in the year 1435. to the Treaty of <hi>Vervins,</hi> in 1598. Wars, Battels, Treaties, Truces, and Peaces.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5.

                  <p n="6">6.

                  <p n="7">7. In the Celtique Gaule he hath the <hi>Franche County,</hi> or the County of <hi>Burgundy;</hi> and in the <hi>Dutchy of Burgundy,</hi> he hath the <hi>County of Charrolois.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. In the Belgique Gaule, he hath poſſeſt, till the end of the laſt age, all that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under the name of the ſeventeen Provinces.

                  <p>In all that large extent of Lands, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> ſuffereth the exerciſe of no Religion but the Roman. Though he go for a great ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, yet many of his Lands depend from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Princes. The See of <hi>Rome</hi> hath great pretences upon the ſoveraignty of <hi>Arragon:</hi> Heacknowledgerh without contradiction, the ſoveraignty of the Church over his Kingdom of <hi>Naples:</hi> Yet it is pretended that he oweth the ſame homage for <hi>Sicily.</hi> For the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> and other Lands, which he holds in <hi>Italy,</hi> he muſt acknowledge the <hi>Empire,</hi> from which he hath received the inveſtiture of the ſame. <hi>Franche County,</hi> is an imperiall fee; as alſo the Provinces of <hi>Netherland</hi> not depending of <hi>France,</hi> did owe homage to the Empire: And in the year 1608. when the truce was made between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Holland;</hi> theſe two States diſputing of their ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the firſt <hi>Article,</hi> the Emperour <hi>Rodol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> framed an oppoſition againſt that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, and claimed the ſoveraignty as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Empire,</hi> but the Treaty paſt without any reflection to that claim. Finally, although
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:120113:7"/>the <hi>Spaniard</hi> acknowledge our Kings no more, neither for <hi>Flanders</hi> nor for <hi>Artois,</hi> it is not well reſolved yet, by what right he hath ſhaken off the yoak; and the <hi>French</hi> pretend that the Treaties of <hi>Madrid, Cambray,</hi> and <hi>Creſpy</hi> in <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lois,</hi> which contain that ceſſion, have not been authorized by the generall States of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King of Spain being poſſeſſor of ſuch a great extent of Lands, is a neighbor to moſt of the Chriſtian Princes, as will be ſhewed more at large in the ſecond Chapter, and hath alwaies ſome difference with them.

                  </p>
                  <p>The ſubjects of the King of <hi>France,</hi> are commonly Roman Catholiques, yet Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants are tolerated in the State.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> is neighbouring upon <hi>Spain,</hi> by the Pyrenean hills. On that ſide the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have not much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled one another but of late yeares, in which the <hi>French</hi> have unfortunately attempted <hi>Spain</hi> about <hi>Fontarabie;</hi> but fortunately about <hi>Rousſillon</hi> and <hi>Catalonia.</hi> But about the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and <hi>Franche County,</hi> which lie open to both the Nations, there hath been much ſtir and action.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>In all theſe States of <hi>Italy,</hi> there is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of any Religion but the Roman.</p>

                  <p>Being now come to the VVeſt, we meet with the moſt conſiderable piece of <hi>Europe,</hi> which is the Empire of <hi>Germany.</hi> The <hi>Empire</hi> begun by <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> but founded by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</hi> poſſeſt all the known Countries of the Weſt. But was greatly diminiſhed about the year of our Lord 400. for then by the incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the <hi>Goths, Oſtrogoths, Alans, Huns, Herules, Vandales, Frankes,</hi> and others; many States were founded. And finally, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire ceaſed in the Weſt, altogether in the year 445. by the death of <hi>Auguſtulus,</hi> and the whole Empire of the Weſt was divided into many States.</p>
                  <p>In the year 800. the <hi>Empire of the Weſt</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun afreſh in the perſon of <hi>Charlemaigne,</hi> who under that name, poſſeſt all the <hi>Gaules,</hi> part of <hi>Spain,</hi> almoſt all <hi>Italie,</hi> the great <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, Hungary, Slavonia,</hi> part of <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> and other Northern Countries. But his poſterity having degenerated, that Empire went from his Family about the year 912. and after a long diſpute about it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Princes, <hi>Othe</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> made himſelf Maſter of it: And from that time, that which remains of the Empire, hath continued in the hands of <hi>German</hi> Princes.</p>

                  <p>That which is called the <hi>Empire</hi> at this day, hath more ſhadow then ſubſtance. I call a ſhadow all the pretences of the Emperour out of <hi>Germanie,</hi> which are worn out with age and loſt, or remain with ſmall vigour, as the pretences of Soveraignty over the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Italy</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries, Savoy, Franche County, Beſancon</hi> and the like. In <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> he hath ſome reall and effective power. <hi>Germany</hi> at this time comprehends all that Country between the border of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi> on the Eaſt, the <hi>Baltique Sea</hi> and <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> on the North, the <hi>Germanique Sea</hi> and <hi>France</hi> on the Weſt, and the River of <hi>Rhine.</hi> and the <hi>Alpes</hi> on the South. Neither is the Emperour abſolute every where, or in the moſt part of that large ſpace. For it is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into ten Circles, or great Provinces, which have a proper right to aſſemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to look to their own buſineſſes, and ſend Deputies to the generall Diets of the Empire. And in every one of theſe Circles, there be many free Cities, and many Secular and Eccleſiaſticall Princes.</p>
                  <p>The chief are the <hi>ſeven Electours,</hi> three Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, the Archbiſhops of <hi>Mentz, Collen,</hi> and <hi>Treues,</hi> four ſecular, the <hi>Count Palatine, the King of Bohemia, the Duke of Saxony,</hi> and <hi>the Marqueſſe of Brandenhurg.</hi> And next to theſe the Duke of <hi>Banteres,</hi> the Duke of

               <p>IT is certain, that among the Chriſtian Princes, the two moſt conſiderable Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies are thoſe of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Auſtria.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be known that the houſe of <hi>France</hi> hath all the Prerogatives of Antiquity, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and Glory above the other; yet that of

                  <hi>Auſtria</hi> is more powerfull for extent of Lands, and multitude of People; and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with a more eminent quality, which is the Empire.

               <p>Now, becauſe theſe two Families draw to their motion, the moſt part of our Chriſtian Weſtern world, and that ſince one hundreth and fifty years the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a ſtupendious growth: It will be to good purpoſe to examine in this Chapter her Birth, Progreſſe, and Greatneſſe.

                  <p>Yet ſo much we will ſay of the houſe of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is certain that this Kingdome was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected out of the ruines of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, in the year 419. <hi>Pharamond</hi> was elected King by the <hi>Frankes,</hi> beyond the <hi>Rhine,</hi> in the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:120113:17"/>Country of <hi>Sicambria,</hi> which is <hi>Guelderland, Uretcht, Freeſeland,</hi> and other Countries thereabout. But neither he, nor his Son <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dion</hi> the <hi>Chevelu,</hi> paſt ever into <hi>France</hi> for any thing that we read; but ſent forth their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to conquer it. <hi>Merovee</hi> the third King, was the firſt that came to <hi>Paris</hi> and took it, and ſetled himſelf with the <hi>Frankes</hi> in <hi>Gauls.</hi> From him was the firſt race of French Kings denominated, and called the race of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rovingians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Clouis</hi> the fifth King, was converted to the Chriſtian faith in the year of Chriſt 500. and brought the French State to great ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, by the expulſion of the reliques of the Romans, near <hi>Soiſſons, Laon,</hi> and <hi>Reins,</hi> by the Conqueſt of <hi>Gaule, Aquitanique,</hi> and by the defeat of <hi>Alaric,</hi> and the Kingdome of the <hi>Goths.</hi> The Sons of that <hi>Clouis</hi> about the year 527. conquered the ſtate of the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> or <hi>Bourguignons:</hi> So that race of the <hi>Merovin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians,</hi> about the year of 530. was poſſeſt of all the <hi>Gaules,</hi> yet divided into <hi>Tetrarchies</hi> by the children of <hi>Clouis,</hi> and again by their deſcent.</p>
                  <p>That race with the <hi>Gauls</hi> held great part of <hi>Germany,</hi> and having done great ſervices to the Church, and protected deſolate Popes, got from them the name of <hi>moſt Chriſtians, &amp; eldeſt Sons of the Church.</hi> When that title was given
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:120113:17"/>them, we cannot preciſely tell; yet Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> who lived in the year 600. ſaith, that the King of <hi>France</hi> is as eminent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove other Kings, as every King is above his Subjects.</p>
                  <p>That firſt race kept long the fierceneſſe of German-barbarouſneſſe, and about the year 650. after the death of <hi>Dagobert,</hi> they degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated to idleneſſe, and ſo continued for a hundred years, which gave occaſion to the <hi>Mayres of the Palace,</hi> to incroach upon the Soveraign Authority. Among whom <hi>Charles Martel</hi> was moſt eminent, who having defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Sarraſins</hi> near <hi>Tours,</hi> and killed three hundred threeſcore and ſix thouſand men, and relieved the <hi>Pope</hi> againſt the <hi>Lombards;</hi> raiſed much the honour of <hi>France</hi> and his own, but to the deſtruction of the firſt Royal line, which ended in the degradation of the unfortunate <hi>Chilperic,</hi> in the year 752. having ſubſiſted 333 years.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The ſecond race much more illuſtrious then the firſt, began in the perſon of <hi>Pipin,</hi> Son to that <hi>Charls Martel.</hi> A valorous &amp; fortunate Prince, devoutly addicted to the Roman See. He received Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> the firſt into <hi>France,</hi> and put down <hi>Adolphus King of the Lombards,</hi> who perſecuted the Pope. But his Son <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemagne</hi> raiſed the State of <hi>France</hi> more then any. For he conquered great part of <hi>Italie</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:120113:18"/>the <hi>Lombards,</hi> and quite deſtroyed them <hi>An.</hi> 774. overcame the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Germany,</hi> conquered part of <hi>Spain</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and made himſelfe maſter of moſt part of the old Empire of the Weſt, and ſo was crowned <hi>Emperour</hi> of the <hi>Weſt, An.</hi> 800. And three years after, limits were ſet in <hi>Italy,</hi> between the two Empires of <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt; Nicephorus</hi> being then Emperour of the Eaſt.

                  <p n="6">6. Theſe firſt Kings were very liberall to the See of <hi>Rome. Pepin,</hi> and <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> gave them the <hi>Exarchat</hi> of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and other Lands which the Popes pretended to have been taken away from them by the <hi>Lombards.

                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Lewis the Meek</hi> left three Sons, <hi>Lothaire</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> by his firſt wife, and <hi>Charles the Bald</hi> from <hi>Judith</hi> his ſecond wife. Theſe three Brothers for three years contended about their partage, the law of the eldeſt being not then in uſe among them, till that cruel bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel of <hi>Fontenay</hi> near <hi>Auxerre</hi> was fought, where above a hundred thouſand men were ſlaine, and eſpecially much Nobility and Gentry whereby the State was weakned, and the Brothers were forced to come to an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trement; That <hi>Lothary</hi> the eldeſt, ſhould have all the Lands beyond the Rivers of <hi>Scaldis</hi> and <hi>Moſa,</hi> as far as the <hi>Rhine,</hi> namely the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>the Low Countries, Liege, Treues, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, Luxemburg, Lorrain, Alſatia,</hi> and others.

This was the ſhare of <hi>Lothary</hi> the eldeſt, who took with it the Title of Emperour. <hi>Lewis,</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Brother, had all that their Father held in <hi>Germany,</hi> and there was called <hi>Germani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus.</hi> To the third, <hi>Charles the Bald, France</hi> was left, much about as it is at this day, incloſed within the narrow Seas of <hi>England, Scaldis, Moſa, Saone, Rhoſne,</hi> the coaſts of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and the <hi>Pyrenees.</hi> That partage of the three
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:120113:19"/>Sons of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Meek, <hi>An.</hi> 843. is the moſt remarkable date of the <hi>French</hi> Hiſtory. Then was that great Monarchy cut in ſhreds, and the greatneſs of <hi>France</hi> humbled, the name of which remained onely to the proportion of a third part. And from that time, the <hi>French</hi> State thus clipt hath remained with little alteration. Onely we have loſt <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Artois,</hi> and many times the borders of the Kingdome have been changed towards <hi>Moſa</hi> and <hi>Scaldis.</hi> But in recompence we have got <hi>Daulphine</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi> beyond the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient bounds.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. As by this partage the State of <hi>France</hi> remained very much diminiſht, ſo the <hi>French</hi> Kings loſt the name of <hi>Emperours,</hi> which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe <hi>Charles the Bald</hi> took ſince.

                  <p n="9">9 <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> head of the third Race, was deſcended as it is thought, from an ancient Houſe of <hi>Saxony</hi> planted in <hi>France,</hi> by <hi>Witti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi> of the race of that other <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikind,</hi> a <hi>Saxon</hi> Prince who ſo long made head againſt <hi>Charlemagne.</hi> This third race began to raigne in the year 987. It is that which this day ſubſiſteth, and beſides her ancient
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:120113:19"/>Nobility before ſhe was Soveraign, hath now held the ſoveraignty above 660 yeares, and beſides innumerable victories obtained over her neighbours, made great Wars againſt the Infidels in the Eaſt, and in <hi>Spain,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Heretiques in all the Provinces of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, keeping ſtill a great reſpect to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> All theſe wayes ſhe hath maintained her ſelfe in the prerogative of precedence and glory above all others. And although he that beares now the quality of <hi>Emperour,</hi> go before the French Kings, becauſe he retaines the name and place of thoſe great Monarchs of all the Weſt, yet he hath neither right nor pretence over the Kings of <hi>France;</hi> yea, <hi>Mr. de Breves,</hi> in the Appendix of the Negotiation of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> added to the Hiſtory of his voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, ſaith, That in <hi>Henry</hi> the 4ths time, he had the precedence before the Ambaſſadors of the Emperour <hi>Rudolphus,</hi> at the <hi>Porta</hi> of the great <hi>Turk,</hi> who judged that the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of Chriſtian Princes, in relation to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Popes, were of no conſideration at his <hi>Porta,</hi> where the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt and the moſt couragious finds moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Alſo whereas the King of <hi>France</hi> was then in War with the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> he would not give his enemy any advantage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him. Neither do the <hi>Turks</hi> acknowledge the Emperour but as King of <hi>Vienna,</hi> but
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:120113:20"/>have a great eſteem for the <hi>French</hi> Kings. But without inſiſting upon the Hiſtory of their third Race now reigning, or making Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyricks of their glory; we will ſay that next to the precedence which they give to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour lawfully elected, they have it over all the Soveraigns of Chriſtendom.</p>

                  <p>Now to underſtand the Origine, progreſſes, and riſing of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> we muſt obſerve,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Empire which was left (as we ſaid) unto <hi>Lothary,</hi> the eldeſt Son of <hi>Lewis the Meeke,</hi> ſubſiſted (though weakly) in the houſe of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> till about the year 912. when <hi>Lewis</hi> the laſt of that race being dead, there was a great contention betweene the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, whereby the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was in confuſion above fifty years, untill <hi>Otho the Great, Duke of Saxony</hi> inveſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of that quality, made himſelfe Maſter of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> the onely remaining pieces of the Empire, in the year 963. and ruined all his competitors. This <hi>Otho</hi> I. was Father of <hi>Otho</hi> II. and he of <hi>Otho</hi> III. after whoſe death the <hi>Germans</hi> aſſiſted by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the V. who himſelfe was a <hi>German,</hi> took upon themſelves the right of creating
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:120113:20"/>Emperours. And from that time all that have peaceably reigned have been <hi>Germans,</hi> becauſe the Popes having made themſelves Maſters of a great part of <hi>Italy,</hi> have done their utmoſt to expell the Emperours out of it, and confine them to <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. As in <hi>France,</hi> by the idleneſſe of the laſt Kings of the 2d Race, the Governours of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces made themſelves Maſters of them, and became Dukes and Earles. Likewiſe the idleneſſe of the ſucceſſors of <hi>Charlemagne</hi> in the Empire, and the confuſions riſen in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> after the extinction of that Race, gave a beginning to ſo many Fees both Secular and Eccleſiaſticall which are now in <hi>Germany,</hi> the Governours having made themſelves Lords, and laid the foundation of the great Houſes now in being. Which nevertheleſſe have gone through many changes, ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies being extinct, and ſome Fees ſold, tranſported, or confiſcated. Among theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, one of the chiefe, and indeed the moſt remarkable at this time, is that of <hi>Auſtria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>French</hi> Kings of the firſt Race, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing a Kingdom of vaſt extent, which they divided into <hi>Oſtrick</hi> and <hi>Weſtrick. Oſtrick</hi> which by corruption and <hi>French</hi> termination, was called <hi>Auſtraſie,</hi> was the Eaſtern part, and comprehended the Countries towards the River <hi>Mſa,</hi> and beyond the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and as far
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:120113:21"/>as <hi>Hungarie, Weſtrick,</hi> which by corruption was called <hi>Neuſtria,</hi> comprehended the <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern</hi> part, from <hi>Moſa</hi> towards <hi>Britain.</hi> Theſe names were long preſerved, even to the age of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> and being loſt by the new par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage between the Children of <hi>Lewis the meek;</hi> yet the name of <hi>Neuſtria</hi> ſtuck long to the Weſtern part, which is now called <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die</hi> (for <hi>Brittain</hi> was a State by it ſelfe.) The name of <hi>Oſtrick</hi> being loſt by the ſame par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, remain'd nevertheleſs to the moſt Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern part, and the next to <hi>Hungary,</hi> and is that which we call <hi>Auſtria,</hi> a word corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Oſtrick</hi> and <hi>Oſtenrick,</hi> and is that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince ſeated upon <hi>Danubius,</hi> where the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall City of <hi>Vienna</hi> ſtands.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In that Country <hi>Otho</hi> the III. about the year 1000 eſtabliſht <hi>Leopold</hi> a <hi>Marquis,</hi> that is a keeper of thoſe Marches againſt the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary excurſions of the <hi>Hungarians.</hi> That <hi>Leopold</hi> is the head of the firſt Houſe of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſſes</hi> ſince Dukes of <hi>Auſtria</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, till a certain <hi>Friderick</hi> who went to the War of <hi>Naples</hi> againſt <hi>Charles</hi> brother of <hi>St. Lewis,</hi> and being taken with <hi>Conradin</hi> a competitor of that Kingdom, was beheaded with him.</p>
                  <p>By his death without Children, <hi>Austria</hi> returned to the Empire. But <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> ſought to joyne it to his State, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:120113:21"/>ſent thither his Sonne <hi>Ottocarus,</hi> who having conſpired againſt the Empire with the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians,</hi> was degraded and put to death by the Emperour <hi>Rudolphus,</hi> of whom we are now to ſpeak.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. By the death of the Emperour <hi>Friderick</hi> the Second, the great enemy of Popes, which was about the year 1231. the factions were ſo great about a new election, that there was an Anarchy of twenty years and above, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe titular Emperours, <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Holland, Richard</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Alphonſus</hi> of <hi>Spain.</hi> In the end, after many aſſemblies and contentions, the Electors gave their Votes to <hi>Rudolphus</hi> Earl of <hi>Habsburg,</hi> who was acknowledged by the whole Empire. That E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection was in the year 1255. five years after the death of St. <hi>Lewis. Philip le Hardy</hi> then raigning in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Between <hi>Baſel</hi> and <hi>Soleurre,</hi> Cantons of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> there is <hi>Trieſtein</hi> Caſtle, the Lords whereof had the Title of <hi>Counts,</hi> and by the women inherited the County of <hi>Habsburg,</hi> and took the Title of the ſame. Of that Houſe was this <hi>Rodolphus</hi> (before whom there is no certainty of the Hiſtory of their Houſe) who by his virtue was elected Emperour, <hi>An.</hi> 1275. and dyed in the 1291. The Dutchy of <hi>Auſtria</hi> being then vacant, and <hi>Ottocarus</hi> the <hi>Bohemian</hi> having invaded it, and made a

                  <p n="4">4. As for <hi>Arragon,</hi> many Kings reigned in it of the line of the foreſaid <hi>Ramires;</hi> and that family paſt through many changes.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:120113:26"/>the Kingdom of <hi>Caſtilia</hi> fell to <hi>Iſabella</hi> whom he married. So his eſtate came to conſiſt of four parts. 1.

The Kingdom of <hi>Granada,</hi> which he and his wife <hi>Iſabella</hi> got from the <hi>Saracens, Anno</hi> 1494. 4. The Kingdome of <hi>Navarra,</hi> out of which he diſpoſſeſt <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Albret, An.</hi> 1512.

He dying without Children, the Crowne fell to his ſiſter <hi>Anne,</hi> whom <hi>Charles</hi> the V. her brother in law preſently cauſed to be married to his brother <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand.</hi> So the two Kingdoms of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Hungary</hi> entred into the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi>

                  <p n="6">6. The State of <hi>Portugal</hi> began about the year 1090. in the perſon of <hi>Henry,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Prince of the Houſe of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued among many changes to the death of King <hi>Sebaſtian, An.</hi> 1579. after whom in the raign of his great Uncle <hi>Cardinal Henry,</hi> there was a diſpute between many contenders for the ſucceſſion. But <hi>Philip</hi> the II. King of <hi>Spain,</hi> got it by Arms, <hi>An.</hi> 1580. claiming right to it by his Mother <hi>Iſabella,</hi> Daughter to King <hi>Emanuel,</hi> for the reaſons which we ſhal ſpeak of in the next Chapter. From that Kingdom depends that of <hi>Algarba,</hi> the Towns of <hi>Ceuta, Tanger,</hi> and <hi>Marſagan</hi> in <hi>Africa.</hi> An infinite number of <hi>Ilands</hi> and <hi>Caps,</hi> from the <hi>Cap of good Hope,</hi> the Kingdoms of <hi>Congo, Angola, Breſia;</hi> And beyond the <hi>Cap of good Hope,</hi> an infinite number of Towns, Iſles, Countries, and Forts, as far as <hi>China,</hi> and the extremity of the Eaſt.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:120113:27"/>then by the right of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> wife to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Charles</hi> the V. that the great Eſtate of <hi>Portugal</hi> was devolved to the Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria.</hi> To which Eſtate they have ſince added ſeveral pieces by conqueſt or otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Charles</hi> the V. got the Lordſhip of <hi>Utrecht</hi> from the Biſhop, as we ſaid before. The ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Artois,</hi> was appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to them (as they pretend) by the Treaties of <hi>Madrid,</hi> An. 1525. Of <hi>Cambray,</hi> An. 1529. Of <hi>Crespy,</hi> An. 1544. The ſame <hi>Charles</hi> got the Town of <hi>Maſtricht,</hi> An. 1530. although the Biſhop of <hi>Liege</hi> pretended the halfe of it to belong to his jurisdiction. In the year 1530. he inveſted <hi>Ludovic Sforza</hi> with the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> upon condition that if he dyed childleſſe, <hi>Philip</hi> the II. King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould ſucceed him, which happened five years after, <hi>An.</hi> 1536. he got the Dutchy of <hi>Guelders,</hi> the County of <hi>Zutfen,</hi> and the Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of <hi>Groning,</hi> by a Treaty with <hi>Charles,</hi> the Duk of <hi>Guelders,</hi> who dyed <hi>an.</hi> 1538. <hi>An.</hi> 1543. he made himſelfe Maſter of the Town of <hi>Cambra,</hi> as Protector of that Imperiall Town, which being ſince got by the <hi>French,</hi> and loſt again, was confirmed to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by the Treaty of <hi>Vervins.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1538. the ſame <hi>Charles</hi> having got the Town of <hi>Siena,</hi> gave it to <hi>Coſmo</hi> Duke of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> to be an homage for it to the King of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:120113:27"/>
                     <hi>Spain,</hi> paying ſix thouſand Ducats of entry at every change of Duke.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philip</hi> the II. King of <hi>Spain,</hi> took from the Turks, <hi>an.</hi> 1554. the Fort of <hi>Fignon, Veles,</hi> and <hi>Gomera,</hi> in <hi>Africa.</hi> An. 1571. he wreſted the <hi>Marquiſat</hi> of <hi>Final</hi> from the Houſe of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reto. Philip</hi> the III. took from the <hi>Moores</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> the Townes of <hi>Arrach</hi> and <hi>Mamora.</hi> Theſe are the principal pieces of that great State of vaſt extent. And I think one may truly ſay, that the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> holds more ground then ever any Prince did: But theſe pieces being ſcattered, that State is not ſtrong, glorious, and form dable according to its extent.</p>
                  <p>That Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> was divided into two branches, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and the <hi>German,</hi> between <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> brothers, and ſucceſſively Emperours, Sons to <hi>Archiduke Philip,</hi> and <hi>Jane</hi> of <hi>Spain. Charles</hi> was the head of the Spaniſh branch, which holds in <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa,</hi> and out of it all that we ſaid before. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand,</hi> brother of <hi>Charles,</hi> was the head of the <hi>German</hi> branch which now holds the Empire. To him <hi>Charles</hi> yeelded the ancient patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Eſtate of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> within the limits of Germany. The ſame <hi>Ferdinand</hi> by his marriage with <hi>Anne,</hi> inheritrix of <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> united thoſe two Crowns to his States. Theſe two Branches at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:120113:28"/>hold theſe Eſtates, ſaving that which <hi>Guſtavus</hi> the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> hath taken from them, and what the <hi>French</hi> have got in theſe Warres from the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> In the Low Countries, <hi>Heſdin, Arras Bapaume, Landrecy, Thionville, Queſnoy, &amp;c.</hi> Towards <hi>Spain</hi> the County of <hi>Rouſſillon</hi> and <hi>Perpignan.</hi> Then the <hi>Catalonians</hi> have revolted and given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the <hi>French.

                  <p>ALthough the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> both the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and the <hi>German,</hi> have pretences different from that of the Empire, which they hold only by Election, and upon Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of yielding, and depoſiting it again in the

                     <p>Concerning that Right, now ſtale, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ridiculous; four things are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Roman Empire which began in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caeſar,</hi> or <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> comprehended indeed all the Weſt, and herein the Gaules. That Empire was made up of the ruine of many Nations, by right or wrong. Howſoever long preſcription, and the conſent of Nations, with the extinction of the royall Families, made up a reaſonable right, which continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:120113:29"/>in the Roman Emperours, till the year of Chriſt, 400; when by the inundation of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Northern Nations; <hi>Goths, Vandales, Franks,</hi> and others; the whole Empire was diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and the ſeverall Conquerors of each part made themſelves Soveraign. So did the <hi>Franks</hi> in <hi>Gaules.</hi> A beginning not to be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of violence and uſurpation. But the ruine of the Romans, preſcription, and the conſent of the conquered people did ſince authorize their dominion, and towards the end of the firſt age of theſe invaſions, they were all ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, and the Conquerours remained juſt poſſeſſours, eſpecially when the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire ended in <hi>Auguſtulus, An.</hi> 475.</p>
                     <p>And when <hi>Charlemagne</hi> reſtored the Weſtern Empire, <hi>an.</hi> 800. that promotion did not alter the former Title he had to the Kingdome of <hi>France.</hi> It was but a Title of honour, which he, and after him his Sonne <hi>Lewis the Meek</hi> poſſeſt, with that of King of <hi>France.</hi> Afterwards, by the partage made <hi>An.</hi> 843. between the Sons of <hi>Lewis the Meek;</hi> each of the three brothers had his portion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent from the others, and <hi>Lothary</hi> the Eldeſt, who had the Title of Emperour, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended no right over <hi>Charles the Bald,</hi> who had <hi>France</hi> for his Portion, much as it is now. Since which time, all that would aſcribe any Superiority to the Emperours, over the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:120113:30"/>Princes of Chriſtendom, that are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Soveraign, have with good reaſon bin hiſſed out as ridiculous. Only the precedence was left to the Emperour as the eldeſt among the brethren. But the ſubjection which he yields to the Pope, and the ſmall right which he retains over the Lands and Princes of the Empire, weaken his authority very much, and make it unworthy of that precedence o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the Princes of Chriſtendom. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doth not ſtir thoſe antient pretences over all the Kingdomes of the Weſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Some Germane Hiſtorians, as <hi>Trithemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Lazius, Munster, Fieſdorpius</hi> make the houſe of <hi>Habsburg</hi> (which is that of <hi>Auſtria</hi>) to deſcend from the firſt race of the French Kings; a fable invented ſince 120. years, and newly taken up again by the flatterers of that houſe. Eſpecially by <hi>Fieſdorpius,</hi> a name ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true or forged by the Spaniards.</p>
                     <p>To underſtand this, we muſt know that the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> was often divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Tetrarchies under the firſt race, Kings of <hi>Paris,</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi> of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> and <hi>Mets.</hi> In the laſt of theſe, <hi>Brunehault</hi> reigned with great power, that abominable woman ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned in our Hiſtories, which confounded and deſtroyed that houſe by her ordinary murthers. That State of <hi>Mets</hi> being fallen into the hands of two brothers, <hi>Thierry</hi> and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:120113:30"/>
                        <hi>Theodebert,</hi> who contended for it; <hi>Therry</hi> joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with his Grandmother <hi>Brunehault,</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>Theodebert</hi> in battell, and put him cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly to death. And by <hi>Brunehaults</hi> order, the two Sons of <hi>Theodebert</hi> were ſlain in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. This Tragedy was acted <hi>An.</hi> 617. But theſe Hiſtorians, to flatter the houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi> ſay, that of theſe two Sons of <hi>Theodebert,</hi> the one, called <hi>Sigebert,</hi> eſcaped the hands of his great Grandmother, and fled into <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> to <hi>Godfrey</hi> and <hi>Genebald,</hi> Dukes of <hi>Franco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi> his Uncles by the Mother, by whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion he obtained of <hi>Lothary</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> his Coſin, ſome lands in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> upon condition that he ſhould renounce all his rights to the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> That he or his Son, or one of his more remote deſcent built the Caſtle of <hi>Habſburg,</hi> and founded that family. And upon that account, the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> deſcends from that of <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That relation is a blind tale; for all anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Hiſtorians affirm, that both the Sons of <hi>Theodebert</hi> (and he had no more) were ſlain by <hi>Brunehault.</hi> And the firſt that mentions that eſcape of <hi>Sigebert,</hi> is <hi>Trithemius,</hi> who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved about ſix ſcore yeares ago. And as it is falſe, it is ridiculous in the ordinary viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the affairs of the world, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall changes of Poſſeſſions, to ſet up Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:120113:31"/>after an interruption of a thouſand years. For, upon that account, there is no Prince in <hi>Europe,</hi> but may be degraded, and no mean man, but may be intitled to ſome principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. It is with great reaſon, that the Title of preſcription is every where preferred before all Titles. And though the tale were a true ſtory, that <hi>Rodolphus</hi> of <hi>Habſburg,</hi> the head of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> was deſcended from the Family of <hi>Habſburg</hi> by the women; his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine extraction was from the houſe of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtein.</hi> So this pretence is ſo ridiculous, that it is not worth ſpeaking.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The branch of the houſe of <hi>Valois</hi> hath continued from male to male from <hi>Philip de Valois,</hi> who came to the Crown, <hi>An.</hi> 1328, to the death of <hi>Henry the Third, An.</hi> 1589. males failing in that branch, the Crown by the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental laws of the Land was to paſs to the next branch of the Males, which was that of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and ſo did in the end. A Title ſo known to all the French, that even in the heat of the War of the League, againſt the honſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> as profeſſing a contrary Religion; yet they crowned the <hi>Cardinal of Bourbon,</hi> and called him <hi>Charles the Tenth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In theſe confuſions, <hi>Philip the Second</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſeeing the party of the <hi>League</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to the Election of a King, claimed the Kingdom for his Daughter <hi>Clara Eugenia

And though that Law had force among the French, that his Daughter being not a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, nor borne in <hi>France,</hi> could not be tied by theſe municipall Laws. That between Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns, the Law of Nature, not the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Laws of Nations ſhould be the rule. That all Laws of Nature reject this principle, that the ſucceſſions ſhould be for males only, as though females were unreaſonable creatures; or the excrements and ſweepings of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and no part of human ſociety.</p>

                     <p>When the States of the League were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in <hi>Paris, An.</hi> 1593. ſome unadviſed and raſh heads moved the Election of a King, and the excluding of the houſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> which ſtirred the Parliament to make that famous Arreſt for the maintaining of the Salique Law, to which the wiſeſt of the <hi>League</hi> yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <hi>Philip the</hi> II. of <hi>Spain,</hi> in that Aſſembly of the States, ſet up his Daughters Title, and preſented her to be Queen. But preſently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the weakneſſe of that Title, and the averſion of the French, from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a woman; he offered to marry her ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a Prince of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> or with one of the Houſe of <hi>Lorraine;</hi> Whoſe imaginary rights were at the ſame time pleaded. And to ſtrengthen all theſe rights, he ſaid, that the Election by the States would ſupply all defects in the Right of ſucceſſion.</p>
                     <p>It appeared, that <hi>Philip</hi> acknowledged the weakneſſe of his Daughters right, ſince he preſented her to be elected. The Salique Law is fundamentall in <hi>France,</hi> wiſely inſtituted, and obſerved twelve hundred years together.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Philips</hi> allegation, that Princes are not to be tied by municipall Laws, but by the Laws of Nature, it is utterly falſe. For in the diſcuſſion of the rights of all Soveraigns, the municipall Lawes are alwaies examined;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:120113:32"/>and none can have right to an Eſtate from which he is excluded by the Law of the Land. The deciſion of all ſuits for Eſtate, is taken out of the cuſtomes of the Land where the Eſtate lyeth; but where thoſe cuſtomes written or unwritten are wanting, the caſe is to be decided by reaſon onely.

                     <p>By that gift, beſides the antient pretence of the Empire upon that Kingdome, at leaſt for the ſoveraignty, the Emperours became Maſters of the ſame both by ſoveraignty and propriety, and annext it to the Empire; At which time the Arch biſhop of <hi>Treves</hi> tooke the name of Cnancellor, <hi>per regnum Arelaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe.</hi> But the Authority of the Emperours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a great decay out of Germany, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially during the Warres betweene the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. and the Popes; four Principalities were framed in that Kingdom of <hi>Arles,</hi> of the <hi>Counts</hi> of <hi>Provence,</hi> the <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins</hi> of <hi>Viennois,</hi> the <hi>Counts</hi> of <hi>Moriurre,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſince <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the <hi>Counts</hi> of <hi>Rurgundy,</hi> which without queſtion depended

                     <p n="2">2. By the partage betweene the Sonnes of <hi>Lewis the Meek, Provence,</hi> with all that was beyond the Rivers of <hi>Rhoſne</hi> and <hi>Saone,</hi> was cut off from the portion, given to <hi>Charles the Bald,</hi> and was ſince called the Kingdome of <hi>Arles.</hi> All theſe pieces given to <hi>Lothary</hi> the eldeſt brother, were called the <hi>Empire,</hi> and Imperial grounds; and to this day the Lands beyond the <hi>Rhone</hi> towards <hi>Italy,</hi> are called <hi>Terres d' Empire,</hi> Lands of the <hi>Empire,</hi> and the Lands at this ſide <hi>Terres de France,</hi> French Lands. Since that partage, the Emperours have alwayes pretended a Soveraignty to thoſe Countries, a right ſtrengthened by the donation made of the propriety of it, to the Emperour <hi>Conrad</hi> the <hi>Salique,</hi> by his Uncle or Brother in law <hi>Rodolphus</hi> the laſt King of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy.</hi>

But the two other pieces of that Eſtate, which <hi>Charles</hi> brother to St. <hi>Lewis</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed with his wife <hi>Beatrix,</hi> which was <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence,</hi> and the Kingdom of the two <hi>Sicilies</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained alwayes united: and the Kings of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> whether of the firſt Houſe of <hi>Anjou,</hi> or of the ſecond, or of the family of <hi>Arragon,</hi> have alwayes claimed a right to the County of <hi>Provence;</hi> ſo that <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence</hi> go under one right, as we ſhall more

                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Jane, Queen of Naples,</hi> of the firſt houſe of <hi>Anjou,</hi> went out of <hi>Italie, An.</hi> 1379. with Pope <hi>Clement</hi> VII. and retired to <hi>Avignon</hi> when that great Schiſm began, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued forty years.

But the conveniency of the place, as lying under the wings of <hi>France,</hi> which might aſſiſt it at any time, kept the poſſeſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the houſe of <hi>Anjou.</hi> And finally, from the houſe of <hi>Anjou</hi> it paſt to that of <hi>France,</hi> being left to <hi>Lewis the</hi> XI. by <hi>Charles Count du Main,</hi> Heir and Nephew to <hi>Rene,</hi> titular King of <hi>Naples,</hi> and reall Poſſeſſor of <hi>Province.

                     <p n="1">1. That <hi>Province</hi> was a purchaſe of <hi>René,</hi> who could diſpoſe of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And that <hi>Province</hi> uſeth the Civil or Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Law, by which teſtaments are free. But the diſcuſſion of that point, is for another place.</p>
                     <p>Howſoever this remains, That the <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Kings after them, have peaceably enjoyed the County of <hi>Province</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 270. years, and the invaders of <hi>Naples</hi> never had any thing in it: Which indeed, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

                        <hi>Paragraphe.</hi> III. <hi>Of the Dutchy of</hi> Burgundy.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>Burgundians</hi> came out of <hi>Germany,</hi> or ſome other Nation of the North, in that great inundation of Northern people over the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, about the year 400. founded a State under the name of the <hi>firſt Kingdom of Burgundy,</hi> about the Rivers of <hi>Saone</hi> and <hi>Rhone,</hi> and near the <hi>Alpes:</hi> And that State ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving begun <hi>An.</hi> 407. was ruined by the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the great <hi>Clovis</hi> about the year 527. and laſted about ſix ſcore years.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Since which time, under the firſt race of the <hi>French</hi> Kings, <hi>Burgundy</hi> was part of the <hi>Kingdom of Orleans;</hi> ſome part of it alſo belonging to the Kingdom of <hi>Mets,</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straſia.</hi> And in the end, the Kingdom of <hi>Mets</hi> and that of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> became all one, till by the partage between the children of <hi>Lewis the Meek,</hi> that part of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> which is beyond the River of <hi>Saone,</hi> remained with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and in the portion of <hi>Lothary</hi> the eldeſt Son. The other on this ſide of the River of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one,</hi>
                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:120113:37"/>was allotted to <hi>France,</hi> and was a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable member of the ſame. Before the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Fees, made in the beginning of the third race; <hi>Burgundy</hi> was governed by Dukes, and three Brothers of <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> the firſt of that race, held it. But the laſt of them, <hi>Robert,</hi> was diveſted of them by his Nephew, <hi>King Robert,</hi> Son to <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> and it was re-united to the Crown. All that was before the two Families of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> of which we are to ſpeak to diſcuſſe the right which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> pretend upon that piece of the <hi>French</hi> State.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. So then from the beginning of the firſt Race, two Royall Families have poſſeſt the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> The firſt began by <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> younger brother to King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Firſt,</hi> and Son to <hi>King Robert.</hi> To him his brother <hi>Henry</hi> gave that Dutchy, in the year 1032. That Family continued from Male to Male, without any interruption of Female ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, untill the death of the laſt Duke <hi>Philip,</hi> dead without iſſue, <hi>An.</hi> 1362. Then King <hi>John</hi> at that time reigning in <hi>France,</hi> ſeizd-upon that piece as an <hi>apanage;</hi> ſo the <hi>French</hi> call the Portions of the Sons of <hi>France,</hi> which are to return to the Crown, when Heirs Male fail. That <hi>apanage</hi> then being returned to the Crown, King <hi>John</hi> beſtowed it in the ſame nature upon his fourth Son <hi>Philip.</hi> This was
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:120113:38"/>the head of the ſecond houſe of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> which had four Dukes only ſucceſſively. This <hi>Philip</hi> called <hi>le Hardy,</hi> inveſted by his Father, then <hi>Iohn,</hi> the third <hi>Philip le Bon,</hi> the laſt <hi>Charles</hi> killed before <hi>Nancy, An.</hi> 1477. who left his Daughter <hi>Mary</hi> his univerſall Heir. She was married to <hi>Maximilian</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> ſince Emperour, and ſo carried all her eſtate into the houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> From that marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age came <hi>Philip Archduke,</hi> married with <hi>Jane,</hi> Inheritrix of all <hi>Spain;</hi> and by her had two Sons, <hi>Charles</hi> the V. and <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, founders of the two Families of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria</hi> that now reign.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. After the death of <hi>Charles,</hi> killed before <hi>Nancy, Lewis the</hi> XI, ſeized upon the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy</hi> as an <hi>apanage</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Crown. Although <hi>Mary</hi> and her Husband <hi>Maximilian</hi> alleaged, that the Dutchy had been given to <hi>Philip the Hardy,</hi> by his Father, <hi>King John,</hi> as an abſolute gift, without any reſtriction of maſculine deſcent. That queſtion, though agitated on both ſides, will alwaies remain undecided. The <hi>French</hi> Kings maintaining themſelves in that poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Charle; the</hi> V. Grandchild to that <hi>Mary,</hi> grounding himſelf upon that right, which we will declare afterwards; required by the Treaty of <hi>Madrid,</hi> that the Dutchy of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi> ſhould be reſtored to him as his by his
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:120113:38"/>Grandmothers right, and taken from her by <hi>Lewis the</hi> XI. But after the return of <hi>Francis the</hi> I, that Treaty was declared void, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to all right of Nations, which diſannull Treaties made in Priſon, and extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by violence, &amp; contrary to the Municilpal Laws of the State of <hi>France,</hi> which conſtitute the Kings to be alwaies <hi>Minors:</hi> that is, unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of abſolute diſpoſition, as for the alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of their Dominions. So the Article of that Treatiſe, concerning the reſtitution of <hi>Burgundy</hi> remained null, though ſigned by the King. Beſides, the States Generall of the Kingdom proteſted to the King, that it was never in his power to alienate any Province of his State without their conſent. Which laſt oppoſition was of ſuch force, that ſince neither in the Treaty of <hi>Cambray,</hi> nor in that of <hi>Creſpy in Valois</hi> (in which ſeverall pieces were yielded unto the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi>) any mention was made of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> Yet the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> take ſtill the Title of <hi>Dukes of Burgundy.</hi> So much for the Fact. We will now examine the right.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It muſt be acknowledged that the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Apanages</hi> for the Males onely, to the excluſion of Females, is not in uſe among the <hi>French</hi> but ſince the time of <hi>Philip de Valois,</hi> who began to reign <hi>An.</hi> 1328; for remount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing higher to <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> we find not that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:120113:39"/>excluſion of Females from ſucceſſions, ſaving the ordinary preference of the Males before them. And the Females were admitted Heirs, in all kinds of eſtates, whether given by the King, or by others. Yea, many times the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Sons of <hi>France</hi> have ended in Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, that have tranſported their Eſtates to other Families; as it appears in that of <hi>Dreux</hi> of <hi>Vermandeis,</hi> of <hi>Courtenay,</hi> and of others. But ſince the time of <hi>Philip de Valois,</hi> no Son of <hi>France</hi> had any <hi>apanage</hi> but upon that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Which is evident, in that all the <hi>apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages</hi> are returned to the Crown by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of Males, to the excluſion of Females, as thoſe of <hi>Anjou, Berry, Alanſon,</hi> and others. Yea, although that firſt houſe of <hi>Burgundy</hi> be much antienter, and hath begun almoſt with the third race; yet as it was the firſt, and moſt important <hi>apanage,</hi> we have in the Hiſtory thereof an example of the excluſion of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males and ſetling the inheritance in the Males. <hi>Hugh the</hi> IV. of that name, Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> had three Sons, <hi>Eudes</hi> his eldeſt, <hi>John</hi> Lord of <hi>Charrolois,</hi> and <hi>Robert the</hi> II. Duke of <hi>Burgundy. Eudes</hi> was married in his Fathers life time, died before him, and left three Daughters, <hi>Joland, Margaret,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice</hi> or <hi>Alix; John</hi> the ſecond Son was marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and died likewiſe before his Father, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Daughter <hi>Beatrix of Burgundy, Lady
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:120113:39"/>of Bourbon.</hi> This was the Lady who being married with <hi>Robert,</hi> Son to <hi>Saint Lewis,</hi> gave a beginning to the houſe of <hi>Bourbon.</hi> When <hi>Eudes the</hi> IV. died, it ſeemed that the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Firſt or Second of his Sons ſhould have inherited by the right of repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Father; but they were excluded from it by their Uncle <hi>Robert,</hi> who enjoyed it, and his Heirs Male peaceably, though theſe four Daughters had been married in great and potent houſes.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Philip</hi> the laſt Duke of that Race being dead, <hi>King John</hi> took the Dutchy in his Poſſeſsion; yet did not reunite it to the Crown, but preſently gave it to his fourth Son, <hi>Philip le Hardy,</hi> whom he eſpecially lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, becauſe he had ſaved his life in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell of <hi>Poitiers,</hi> though he was then very young. He gave it him by a long Charter, which indeed contains not in expreſſe termes the exception of Female Heirs; but conferrs it upon him <hi>with the ſame rights by which himſelf came by it, and by which he poſſeſſeth it.</hi> Termes which have cauſed difficulty, becauſe <hi>John</hi> could be ſaid to ſucceed to it by two rights; the one as King, the other as the next Heir-male of the laſt Duke. If he ſucceeded to it as King, the Dutchy being an <hi>apanage,</hi> returning to the Crown in defect of Heir-Male, then without doubt it was ſetled upon
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:120113:40"/>his Son <hi>Philip</hi> as a maſculine <hi>apanage,</hi> both becauſe his Father gave it him with the ſame right by wh<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> himſelf had got it. And becauſe the ſevere Law of <hi>Apanages</hi> was already in uſe from <hi>Philip de Valois,</hi> Father to <hi>John,</hi> and never was interrupted ſince.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. But King <hi>John</hi> (ſay the <hi>Spaniards</hi>) inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited of the laſt Duke as the next of blood, and his Heir, <hi>ab inteſtato,</hi> becauſe it appeareth in the Genealogy of that firſt Race of <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> that <hi>Robert</hi> the II, he that had excluded his four Neeces, was Father to <hi>Hugh</hi> the V. who dyed without iſſue, and of <hi>Eudes</hi> the IV. both ſucceſſively Dukes of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> This laſt was Grandfather to <hi>Philip</hi> the laſt Duke, who ended the maſuline line. But that <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> the II. had three Daughters beſides <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi> wife to King <hi>Lewis Hutin,</hi> whence came the houſe of <hi>Navarra, Jane</hi> wife to King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip de Valois,</hi> and mother to King <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> wife to <hi>Edward</hi> Count of <hi>Bar.</hi> They ſay then, that after the death of <hi>Philip</hi> the laſt Duke. King <hi>John</hi> took that Dutchy by the right of his mother <hi>Jane,</hi> which right he tranſported to his Son <hi>Philip le Hardy,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mention of maſculine apanage, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they will have it evident, that femals may inherit it.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Againſt that pretended right which was very much diſputed in the Treaty of <hi>Madrid,</hi>
                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:120113:40"/>the <hi>French</hi> have ſtrong exceptions.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, That from the time of <hi>Philip de Valois,</hi> within which that gift was made, no Son of <hi>France</hi> had any great <hi>Apanage</hi> but with that reſtriction, againſt which whatſoever King <hi>John</hi> may have ſaid or done (and he was a very imprudent and raſh man) he could do no valuable deed to the detriment of the State, or againſt the fundamental Lawes.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Reaſon is, That ſince we ſee by the example of <hi>Hugh</hi> the IV. that females are excluded from that ſucceſſion, we muſt acknowledge that <hi>John</hi> did not ſucceed by right of his mother, but as King, receiving an apanage devolved unto him.</p>
                     <p>The third Reaſon is, That King <hi>John</hi> was not the next Heir in blood, for by proximity of blood, the children of the <hi>eldeſt</hi> Daughter, which was <hi>Margaret</hi> wife to King <hi>Lewis Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> ſhould have ſucceeded, not King <hi>John,</hi> who was Son to the <hi>ſecond.</hi> Now that ſucceſſion fell when that wicked man <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>Navarra,</hi> Grandchild to that <hi>Margaret</hi> was in his ſtrength, who if there had beene any life in that title, would not have failed to have ſet it up; for <hi>Burgundy</hi> was better then all his <hi>Navarra,</hi> and the reſt of his eſtate. And yet that ſtirring man did not ſtirre that point, or it was ſo ſlightly, that he left off pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently; but hotly purſued a recompence for
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:120113:41"/>the Counties of <hi>Champagne</hi> and <hi>Brie,</hi> which by right belonged to his mother <hi>Jane,</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Lewis Hutin,</hi> Sonne to <hi>Jane</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Champagne</hi> and <hi>Brie,</hi> Queen of <hi>Navarra,</hi> wife to <hi>Philip le Bel.</hi> By all this it is evident, that the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy</hi> was ſetled upon <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip le Hardy</hi> his Son, in the nature of a true maſculine <hi>apanage.</hi>

                        <hi>Paragraphe</hi> IV. <hi>Of the Towns of</hi> Metz, Thoul, <hi>and</hi> Verdun.</head>
                     <p>By the partage ſo famous among the Sons of <hi>Lewis the Meek,</hi> an. 843. it is certaine that all that was beyond the River <hi>Moſa</hi> towards <hi>Germany,</hi> was cut off from that which retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the name of Kingdome of <hi>France;</hi> and that theſe three Towns remained Imperiall. But <hi>Moſa</hi> being the bound of theſe two States, the Empire and the Kingdome; yet by an infinity of Warres, Uſurpations, and Treaties, that bound and other limits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two States were often changed. In the time of the weakneſs and declination of the Houſe of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> moſt part of the Cities and Lordſhips of the Empire, did can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton themſelves, and made themſelves parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Dominions under the protection of the Empire, and ſome remained free, others were ſubjected to eſpecial Lords, ſome Lay,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:120113:41"/>ſome Eccleſiaſtical. All theſe make up now the great body of the Empire: Of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were theſe three Towns, <hi>Metz, Thoul,</hi> and <hi>Verdun,</hi> upon which the <hi>French</hi> Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended no right till the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the II.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An.</hi> 1550. the Proteſtants of <hi>Germany</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Henry</hi> the II. to their help, againſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Charles</hi> the V. <hi>Henry</hi> ſent them great Auxiliary forces by <hi>Ann de Montmorency</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable of <hi>France,</hi> who in his way ſeized upon <hi>Thoul</hi> and <hi>Verdun,</hi> &amp; put Garriſons into them to aſſure the paſſage of the <hi>French</hi> Forces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Germany.</hi> The Government of <hi>Thoul</hi> was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Monſieur d'Eſclavoles,</hi> Lieutenant of the company of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi> And <hi>Charles</hi> Cardinall of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> was reſtored to his Lordſhip, annext to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Verdun,</hi> the King retaining the ſoveraignty for himſelfe, which he thought he could lawfully doe, becauſe the Lord of it was his ſubject, and had an eſtate in <hi>France;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Emperour was his declared enemy, whoſe Eſtate he might invade. In the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition the Conſtable ſeized on the City of <hi>Metz,</hi> which the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the V. beſieged towards the end of the yeare 1551. but in vain, ſince which time the <hi>French</hi> have enjoyed theſe three Cities; yet finding their right ſome what weak, they uſed it at the firſt with great moderation, calling themſelves
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:120113:42"/>only Guardians and Protectors of the ſame, till <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIII. cauſed them to be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incorporated with <hi>France,</hi> and in them hath eſtabliſht a ſoveraign Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>Indeed theſe three Townes have of long continuance been Imperial, and being got by ſubtilty, upon pretence of the ſurety of the paſſage, the right of the <hi>French</hi> Kings in them ſhould be much more diſputable then in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other places, as themſelves have confeſt in many of their inſtructions for the generall Treaties. Yet it may be ſaid for the <hi>French,</hi> that <hi>Henry</hi> the II. took them as his enemies eſtate, when he made War againſt the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</hi> That the Emperour never made ſince any ſtipulation for the reſtitution of them in any Treaty. That the rights of the Empire on this ſide of <hi>Rhine,</hi> are ſo vaniſht and loſt, that the Countries ſeem now to be <hi>primum occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panti.</hi> That <hi>Holland,</hi> alſo <hi>Lorraine, Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Savoy, Franch County, Daulphiné, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence,</hi> were Imperiall Lands; and yet all theſe are ſlipt from the Empire by a preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion grounded upon the weakneſs and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the old Soveraigne. Alſo that the French Kings at the firſt, declared themſelves onely Protectors and Guardians of theſe Towns: which if afterwards they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated to their State, it was by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:120113:42"/>of the people, ſeeing themſelves deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and neglected by the Empire. Finally, in that point the <hi>French</hi> think they may uſe the right of Repreſals. And that if the Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> ſhould do them right about all their pretences, there would be ſome reaſon why the Emperour ſhould be contented about theſe Towns.</p>

                     <p>The four Dukes of the laſt Houſe of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi> were <hi>Philip le Hardy, John, Philip le Bon,</hi> and <hi>Charles.</hi>

                        <hi>John,</hi> after the death of his Father <hi>Philip le Hardy, an.</hi> 1404. cauſed great troubles in the State of <hi>France,</hi> and cauſed his Couſin German, <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to be ſlain, <hi>an.</hi> 1407. whence ſprung thoſe great Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Wars between thoſe two Houſes, of which the Hiſtories are full. That <hi>John</hi> was ſlain at <hi>Montereau foult-Ronne,</hi> by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Dolphin, an.</hi> 1419. His Son <hi>Philip de Bon,</hi> purſued with great power and eagerneſſe the vengeance of that death, made league with the Engliſh, and diſtreſſed very much the Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi> In the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:120113:43"/>end ſeeing himſelf ill uſed by the Engliſh, he grew weary of their alliance, and aſhamed of the harm which he had done to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Being then contented to agree with the King, he met with him at <hi>Arras, An.</hi> 1435. This was called the Treatie of <hi>Arras,</hi> a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall piece of the Hiſtory of that age, and the following. By that Treaty, after that King <hi>Charles</hi> the VII. in as little diſhonorable termes as might be, had asked pardon for the killing of <hi>Duke John,</hi> when he was <hi>Dolphin,</hi> they agreed about many other Articles, and the <hi>King</hi> gave many pieces belonging to the Crown. The chief were theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He tranſported to the Duke, and to his Heirs lawfully begotten, the Towns and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictions of <hi>Peronne, Roye, Mondidier,</hi> to hold them by homage from the Crown, and in Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Peerdom, to depend of the Court of Parliament of <hi>Paris.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2.

                     <p n="3">3. He tranſported to the ſaid Duke the Towns of <hi>Saint Quintin, Corbi, Amiens, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beville, Dourlans, Saint Riquier, Crevecoeur,</hi> and all the other Towns, Caſtles, and Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips

All theſe Towns, Caſtles, and Lordſhips, redeema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the ſum of 400000 Crowns. Upon that Treaty all theſe Towns were delivered to the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and all the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the VII. nothing was altered in this agreement.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lewis the</hi> XI. came to the Crown. <hi>An.</hi> 1461. who being unthankfull and malicious, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had great obligations to the houſe of <hi>Burgundy;</hi> yet as ſoon as he came to the Crown, he conceived a great averſion againſt <hi>Charles Count of Charolois,</hi> Son and Heir to <hi>Philip le Bon,</hi> and would recover all thoſe pawned Lordſhips, arguing the Treaty of <hi>Arras,</hi> of nullity and invalidity, maintaining that his Father could not alienate ſo many pieces belonging to the State, againſt the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Laws. To diſingage theſe Lands, he laid great impoſitions upon the people, till he had raiſed the four hundred thouſand Crownes, which he cauſed to be brought to <hi>Abbeville,</hi> and delivered unto the Duke, who ſoon after delivered all thoſe places unto him. <hi>Charles</hi> Count of <hi>Coarolois</hi> took that ſo heavily, that he almoſt died for ſorrow, and conceived a mortall hatred againſt the Lord

                     <p>The right of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> to the Dutchy of <hi>Britain,</hi> hath more ground then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the former, and gave matter to many diſputes, eſpecially in the time of the <hi>League;</hi> the King of <hi>Spain, Philip</hi> the II. repreſenting the rights of his Daughter <hi>Iſabella,</hi> both to the Kingdom, and eſpecially to that Dutchy. And when the Duke of <hi>Mercoeur,</hi> who had cantonned himſelfe in it (finding himſelf too weak to maintain his own pretence to it, which was upon another ground) threatned to give entrance to the Spaniards into the Dutchy, <hi>La Gueſle</hi> the Kings Atturney Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, made a long ſpeech to defend the Kings right, of which the ſummary is this.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That <hi>Francis</hi> the II. the laſt Duke of <hi>Britain</hi> dying <hi>An.</hi> 1488. left two daughters, <hi>Anna</hi> and <hi>Iſabella.</hi> The ſecond died young. The eldeſt, <hi>Anne,</hi> had the whole ſucceſſion, and was married firſt to <hi>Charles the</hi> VIII. of <hi>France,</hi> by whom though ſhe had many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:120113:45"/>none outlived the Father: Who being dead, ſhe was married with his ſucceſſour <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII. by whom ſhe had two Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>Claude</hi> married to <hi>Francis the</hi> I. who by her had <hi>Henry</hi> the II, who was Father to three Kings, <hi>Francis the</hi> II. <hi>Charles the</hi> IX, <hi>Henry the</hi> III. and to <hi>Francis Duke of Alanſon,</hi> all which left no iſſue. He was Father alſo of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the Third, Wife of <hi>Philip the</hi> II. King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who by her had the <hi>Infanta Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi> Wife to <hi>Archiduke Albert,</hi> and Princeſs of the Low-Countries, died <hi>An.</hi> 1633, and <hi>Catherine, Dutcheſſe of Savoy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. By the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the III, all the maſculine Race of <hi>Valois</hi> was extinct, and the next Heir of that houſe was <hi>Infanta Iſabella,</hi> daughter to <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the eldeſt Siſter of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the</hi> III. So if there was any Eſtate in that houſe inheritable by women, it belonged to <hi>Iſabella</hi> without queſtion. <hi>Philip</hi> the II, deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his daughter after he was once ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that his pretence to the Crown of <hi>France</hi> in her behalfe was ridiculous, asked that at leaſt the Dutchy of <hi>Britain</hi> ſhould be reſtored to her, as the Eſtate w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> her great Grandmother <hi>Anne of Britain</hi> had brought to <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII, an Eſtate which often had paſt to Females, ſaying (as it was true) that ſhe was the next in blood.</p>

                     <p>To theſe allegations theſe anſwers are given.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the Dutchy of <hi>Britain</hi> had been inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapably united w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the Crown, by the coming of <hi>Henry</hi> the II. to the Crown; for it is a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall rule among the French, that a King coming to the Crown, uniteth unto the ſame all his Eſtate, both Paternall and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Beſides that tacit and municipall right, to which all contrary pretence muſt yield; there was an expreſſe union made <hi>An.</hi> 1532. at the requeſt of the States Generall of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> by <hi>Francis</hi> the I. upon condition, that the <hi>Dolphin</hi> ſhould take the Title of <hi>Dolphin of Viennois, Duke of Britain;</hi> which was then practiſed in the perſon of the <hi>Dolphin Francis,</hi> but was ſince neglected. That au thenticall union of <hi>Britain</hi> with the Crown, cannot be diſputed, ſince the conſent of the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince did intervene, and that in all publique buſineſſes, all private rights, muſt bow and yield to the publique good, <hi>Salus populi ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma lexeſto.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Beſides, ever ſince <hi>John of Montford</hi> by the battell of <hi>Auray An.</hi> 1364. remained Maſter of the Dutchy, and excluded <hi>Jane</hi> his Coſen-German, Wife to <hi>Charles de Blois,</hi> objecting that ſhe was a woman, and that women vvere not capable Heirs of Eſtates of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:120113:46"/>that nature; Since that time, I ſay it may be affirmed that Females were excluded from the ſucceſſion of <hi>Britain.</hi> And that if <hi>Anne,</hi> Wife to the two Kings, <hi>Charles</hi> the VII. and <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII. was admitted to it, it was by toleration; For by right, after the death of <hi>Francis</hi> the laſt Duke, the Dutchy was devol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the Crown. And truly, <hi>Francis</hi> the laſt Duke, by his great revolts, had given ſufficient cauſe to the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> his Soveraigns to deprive him of his Eſtate.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The French alſo may here ſet up the right of <hi>Aubeine,</hi> which excludeth ſtrangers, &amp; admitted none but <hi>regnicolae,</hi> inhabitants of the Kingdom to ſucceſſions. Which muſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially be obſerved in great Eſtates and moſt of all in thoſe that owe a <hi>liedge homage.</hi> For whereas the Duke of <hi>Britain</hi> did owe perſonal ſervice to the King; how can a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man born in <hi>Spain,</hi> tyed with blood and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe unto a houſe alwaies jealous, and often declared Enemy of the State of <hi>France,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that part of her duty to the Crown? a duty abſolutely neceſſary for the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body of the State unto which the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhing of all <hi>Fees</hi> muſt have regard.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The French may deale beſides with the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> by right of <hi>repreſals.</hi> For ſince that houſe withholds ſo many Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:120113:46"/>and Counties from the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> without any recompence or ſatisfaction; they think not themſelves bound to give ear to their pretences upon ſo little ground.</p>

                  <p>All the pretences of the French upon the poſſeſsions of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> are either

                  <p>Though I might omit thoſe firſt pretences as too ſtale, yet I will here ſet them down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt, for the information of curious Readers.</p>

Yet becauſe <hi>Beringera</hi> was within the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and <hi>Blanch</hi> lived in <hi>France</hi> very farre, ſhe ſeized upon the ſtate, and with it inveſted her Son <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> although many of the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees oppoſed it, ſtanding for the right of <hi>Blanch,</hi> which cauſed great troubles till St. <hi>Lewis</hi> to whom <hi>Caſtilia</hi> belonged after his Mother, thus compoſed the difference.</p>
                     <p>

By the contract of marriage, it was agreed that S. <hi>Lewis</hi> yielded all his rights over <hi>Caſtilia,</hi> to his Daughter <hi>Blanch,</hi> and her Children after her; upon which conditions performed, <hi>France</hi> loſt her claime upon that Kingdome; but that <hi>Ferdinand de la Cerda</hi> dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before his Father <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> and his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:120113:49"/>Brother <hi>Sanchez</hi> uſurped the Crown, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving his Nephews, Sons to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Blanch,</hi> of their right.

                     <p>Out of that diſcourſe, four things doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult for our purpoſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That after the death of <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Caſtilia,</hi> all the right of the Kingdome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to his ſiſter <hi>Blanch,</hi> and after her, to her Son St <hi>Lewis;</hi> and that <hi>Berengera</hi> the younger ſiſter of <hi>Blanch,</hi> and her Son <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi> were uſurpers.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That St <hi>Lewis</hi> indeed yeelded his rights by the contract of marriage between <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand de la Cerda,</hi> and his Daughter <hi>Blanch.</hi> One might ſay, that it was more then he could doe; for the rights of the Crown can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be alienated. But they had not then ſuch abſolute maxims, and were not ſo jealous as now of preſerving the union of States, which in thoſe dayes were often divided, exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:120113:49"/>bought and ſold. And St <hi>Lewis</hi> ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently perceived the impoſſibility of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Caſtilians</hi> together.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But that Ceſſion was conditionall, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring that the Children of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Blanch,</hi> ſhould inherit the Crown. That con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition having been violated by the uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Sanchez,</hi> younger Brother to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and the poor Princes, Children to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Blanch,</hi> being diſinherited and proſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, that ceſsion of St <hi>Lewis</hi> becomes void by right, and the claim of the <hi>French</hi> might be good, if it was not ſomewhat too old.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. At leaſt all that Right of St <hi>Lewis</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines with the deſcendants of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Blanch,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Medina Coeli,</hi> for they have double right, the one from <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi> as elder Brother to <hi>Sanchez;</hi> the other from <hi>Blanch,</hi> to whom her Father St <hi>Lewis</hi> had conferred his right. And if the Houſe of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina Coeli</hi> would proſecute it, they ſhould be well grounded, and the <hi>French</hi> Kings might defend their claim very juſtly, as their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors and fetching their right from them.</p>

The moſt eminent was <hi>Henry,</hi> of the firſt Royal Houſe of <hi>Burgundy;</hi> for although there hath been much diſpute about his Origine, now all Hiſtorians acknowledge that he was Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child to <hi>Robert,</hi> Brother to King <hi>Henry</hi> the I, who had <hi>Burgundy</hi> given him for his <hi>apanage.</hi> This <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> having done great exploits againſt the <hi>Moores,</hi> married <hi>Tereſa,</hi> naturall Daughter of <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> who gave her for her portion the Townes of <hi>Coimbra,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:120113:50"/>Braga,</hi> and others in <hi>Portugal,</hi> with forces to conquer the reſt, of which he quitted himſelf ſo well, that he expelled the Infidels from great part of <hi>Portugal,</hi> of which he was called <hi>Comes</hi> or <hi>Count,</hi> and no other title did he bear all his life time. He dyed <hi>an.</hi> 1112. and left a Son named <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> who took <hi>Lisbone,</hi> and much Country beſides, and was called the firſt King of <hi>Portugal, an.</hi> 1139. From that <hi>Alphonſus</hi> is deſcended the whole Houſe of <hi>Portugal,</hi> till the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>King, an.</hi> 1580. at which time <hi>Portugal</hi> was united with <hi>Spain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The great difficulty about the ſucceſſion of that Kingdom, whether it belong to the houſe of <hi>Spain,</hi> or to that of <hi>Braganza,</hi> or to that of <hi>Parma,</hi> is nothing to this purpoſe. It hath wearied the reaſoning of the greateſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lititians for threeſcore yeares, and finally hath ended in a generall revolt of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and a bloody War. Certainly, although ſuch as are moſt jealous of the growth of <hi>Spaine,</hi> will vote for the Houſe of <hi>Braganza,</hi> and that of <hi>Parma,</hi> the queſtion is not without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>France</hi> hath a further pretence to the Kindom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> for which we muſt remount higher. <hi>Alphonſus</hi> the II, King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> had two Sons, <hi>Sanchez</hi> the II, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Capel,</hi> and <hi>Alphonſus. Sanchez</hi> raigned
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:120113:51"/>after his Father, but with ſmall vigour, and was deſpiſed by his ſubjects. <hi>Alphonſus</hi> living then in the Court of St <hi>Lewis,</hi> where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived much honour, as being his kinſman by <hi>Blanch</hi> of <hi>Caſtilia</hi> the Kings Mother. By his meanes he married <hi>Mahaut</hi> of <hi>Dampmartin,</hi> Widow to a Prince of the blood, <hi>an.</hi> 1235. and by her had Children. The people of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> weary of their King <hi>Sanchez,</hi> deſired <hi>Alphonſus</hi> to come home, and take the tuition of the State, which he did, leaving his wife <hi>Mahaut</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> And his Brother being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded and himſelfe made King, he forgot his wife and children in <hi>France,</hi> and married <hi>Beatrix,</hi> naturall Daughter of <hi>Alphonſus</hi> the IX King of <hi>Caſtilia,</hi> who gave her for her por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Kingdom of <hi>Algarba.</hi> Becauſe his firſt wife was living, that 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> marriage was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted unlawful; yea, <hi>Alphonſus</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated for it by <hi>Pope Alexander</hi> the IV. and hated by all the Princes; and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haut</hi> coming into <hi>Spain,</hi> made a heavy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint againſt him. Who was ſo hardened in that ſin, that he proteſted that if a hundred wives would have him, he would marry them all. Yet being a great Warriour, and a wiſe and proſperous King, he maintained himſelf by the love of his ſubjects, inſomuch that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haut</hi> being dead, the Biſhops of <hi>Portugal</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his abſolution of <hi>Urban</hi> the IV. and the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:120113:51"/>confirmation of that ſecond marriage of which he had Children. One of them, and his ſucceſſour, was <hi>Denis, Alphonſus</hi> being dead, <hi>an.</hi> 1279. From that <hi>Denis</hi> are deſcended all the Kings of <hi>Portugal</hi> to this day.</p>
                     <p>Some of the <hi>French</hi> Hiſtorians affirme, that <hi>Mahaut</hi> had two Sons by <hi>Alphonſus</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> the one that dyed young, the other <hi>Robert,</hi> from whom the whole Houſe of the Counts of <hi>Bullen</hi> is deſcended, which fell to <hi>Magdalen de la Cour,</hi> wife to <hi>Laurens</hi> of <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> by whom came <hi>Katherine de Medicis,</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the three late <hi>French</hi> King, <hi>Francis</hi> the II. <hi>Charles</hi> the IX, and <hi>Henry</hi> the III, after whoſe death (by the ſubſtitution ſet downe before in the contract betweene her and <hi>Henry</hi> the II,) the inheritance of <hi>Katherine</hi> came to her Daughter Queen <hi>Margaret,</hi> firſt Wife to <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. That Queen made the <hi>Dolphin</hi> of <hi>France</hi> her Heir, who ſince was <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIII.</p>
                     <p>When the diſpute for the ſucceſſion of <hi>Portugal</hi> was open, after the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Cardinal King</hi> an. 1530, <hi>Katherine</hi> Queen of <hi>France,</hi> among other pretenders to that Crown, ſet forth her claim by <hi>Belloy,</hi> Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Generall in the Parliament of <hi>Toulouſe,</hi> who pleaded that from the marriage of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſus</hi> and <hi>Mahaut,</hi> a Son was born called <hi>Robert,</hi> and had ſucceeded in all his rights,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:120113:52"/>that <hi>Beatrix</hi> was the Concubine, not the wife of <hi>Alphonſus;</hi> and that the Pope could not le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate <hi>Denis</hi> born of adultery, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of <hi>Robert</hi> the true Heir of <hi>Alphonſus.</hi> Alſo that all the Kings that had reigned ſince <hi>Denis</hi> for three hundred years, made no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, becauſe there can be no preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the right of Kingdoms. That right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing propounded to the Eſtates of <hi>Portugal,</hi> was found too old and ſtale, and injurious to all their Kings; neither did they make any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it. Beſides, the Spaniſh Hiſtorians affirm, that <hi>Alphonſus</hi> had no iſſue by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haut,</hi> and that among the proteſtations which <hi>Mahaut</hi> made in <hi>Portugal</hi> againſt <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> there is not one word of the injury which he did to her children, which ſhe would not have forgot if ſhe had had any: Yet that right may be defended by the teſtimony of the French Hiſtorians, and by this true allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that neither a baſtard nor his Deſcent can preſcribe againſt the lawfull Heirs.</p>

                     <p>The like may be ſaid of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> which is a great Province of <hi>Spain,</hi> bounded on the Eaſt and South with the Mediterranean Sea, and on the other ſides with <hi>Valentia, Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> and <hi>Rouſſillon.</hi> It was both before the Romans and under them, part of <hi>Hiſpania Tarraconenſis,</hi> as <hi>Arragon</hi> and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries near the River of <hi>Ebro.</hi> Since which time being conquered by the <hi>Gotths</hi> and <hi>Alans</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it was called by them <hi>Gottalania,</hi> which name was ſince corrupted to <hi>Catalau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi> It was under the Kings of the <hi>Gotths,</hi> till the invaſion of the <hi>Saracens, an.</hi> 713. who made themſelves Maſters of it, as of moſt part of <hi>Spain;</hi> But <hi>Charlemagne</hi> took it from them, and all the Country near the River of <hi>Ebro,</hi> about the year 800. expelling <hi>Zaron</hi> the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:120113:57"/>
                        <hi>Moore</hi> out of <hi>Barcellona,</hi> and put a French Garriſon in it; not long after he gave it to <hi>Bernard,</hi> who was the firſt Count of <hi>Catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and was a powerfull and conſiderable man in the Court of <hi>Lewis the Meek;</hi> and the <hi>Counts</hi> of that Province, who then were but Goverours, were a long time ordinary Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers and Attendants of the French Kings. But by the idleneſſe of the laſt deſcent of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> the Governours of Provinces; and of this among the reſt, made themſelves Maſters.</p>
                     <p>About the beginning of the third Race of the <hi>French</hi> Kings, the Family that ruled in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> was that of the <hi>Beringers.</hi> And that County was alwayes ſeparate from the Kingdom of <hi>Arragon,</hi> till the yeare 1131, when <hi>Don Alphonſo</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> ſurna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the <hi>Bellador,</hi> becauſe he fought twenty two battels, being dead without iſſue, the people of <hi>Arragon</hi> tooke <hi>Ramires</hi> out of the <hi>Cloiſter</hi> of St. <hi>Pontius</hi> of <hi>Tomieres,</hi> where he had lived forty yeares a Monk, becauſe he was of the Royal blood, and Son to <hi>Sanchez Ramires,</hi> King of <hi>Arragon.</hi> He was married by a diſpenſation of <hi>Anaclet</hi> the II, Pope, or rather Anti-pope, and had a Daughter na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Petronilla,</hi> married to <hi>Raymond Berenger,</hi> Count of <hi>Catalonia.</hi> So <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Catalonia</hi> were united, and never ſeparated ſince. <hi>James</hi>
                        <pb n="113" facs="tcp:120113:57"/>King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> an. 1320. by the advice of the State of the Land, made the Law of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the three Provinces, <hi>Arragon, Valentia,</hi> and <hi>Catalonia,</hi> not to be poſſeſt ſeparately any more. Together with that Law, <hi>Catalonia</hi> agreed with the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> that ſhe ſhould have her forces and priviledges <hi>apart;</hi> and that the Kings of <hi>Arragon,</hi> who took on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the title of Counts of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> ſhould oblige themſelves by oath to obſerve that condition. This precaution of the <hi>Catalans</hi> hath juſtified their laterevolt, which the moſt conſcionable among them have yeelded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, acknowledging that their King had viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that Treaty.</p>
                     <p>It is a conſtant truth, that all that time, from the conqueſt of <hi>Charlemagne, Catalonia,</hi> was a <hi>Fee</hi> depending from France; <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magne</hi> made the firſt Counts of it, who were his Courtiers. The firſt upon whom it was ſettled, as a French <hi>Fee,</hi> was <hi>Geffery le Velu,</hi> inveſted by <hi>Charles le Gros, an.</hi> 885. And <hi>Bera</hi> Count of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> being accuſed of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony before <hi>Lewis le Begue</hi> offered to purge himſelfe by a Duell after the manner of the time, in which being overcome, he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of his Fee, and another inveſted with it.</p>
                     <p>All that time alſo, all the publique Acts of Notaries in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> were done in the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:120113:58"/>name of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> which is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted mark of Supremacy, and all the Kings of <hi>Arragon,</hi> Counts of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> did homage for it to the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> till the yeare 1181. and in the beginning of <hi>Philip</hi> the Conquerour, when <hi>Alphonſus</hi> King of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon</hi> called a Councill at <hi>Tarracona,</hi> a Town of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> where under colour of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and reſpect to Religion, he cauſed an Order to be made, that from thenceforth the yeares of the French Kings ſhould no more be put in the Deeds and Contracts of <hi>Catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> but the yeares of Chriſt. And the ſame King having neglected that homage to the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> that right was loſt under <hi>Philip Auguſte, Lewis</hi> the VIII. and St <hi>Lewis,</hi> the claim onely remaining. In which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, likely the Princes of <hi>Arragon</hi> were educated in the Court of <hi>France;</hi> one of them was <hi>James,</hi> who lived in the time of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> and had been educated with <hi>Philip le Hardy,</hi> who being come to viſit that King, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given him his ſiſter <hi>Iſabella</hi> to wife; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſay, that by reaſon of that match, and the ceſſion which <hi>James</hi> made to <hi>Philip</hi> of the Town of <hi>Monpellier,</hi> and of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lands which he poſſeſt in <hi>Languedoc;</hi> the ſaid King <hi>Philip</hi> quitted all his right of ſupremacy over <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Catalonia.</hi> That Treaty was <hi>an.</hi> 1270, by which the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:120113:58"/>conceive that they have ſhaken the yoak of French Soveraignty. But whether that Treaty be valid or no, either for the fact or the right, that ceſſion being above 380 years old, it ſeems authenticall, and the French have given over that claim.</p>
                     <p>But they have another of latter date. For by reaſon of the maſſacre made in the <hi>Siclian Veſpers,</hi> an. 1281. <hi>Peter</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> Count of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> was excommunicated, &amp; his Lands put in interdict, and given to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip le Hardy,</hi> by <hi>Martin</hi> the IV, Pope, or to his Son Count of <hi>Valois;</hi> but that right being the ſame, as the right which the French claime, or did claim upon <hi>Arragon,</hi> of which we ſpake lately, we will not here repeat.</p>
                     <p>So the French rights over <hi>Catalonia,</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to theſe two heads. The firſt is taken from the conqueſt of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhing of Counts and Governours in the ſame, the homage done to the Kings of France, the years of their reign aſcribed in their deeds both private and publique. The other is the ſame, as is pretended upon <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon.</hi> Of both, the French make no great account. Onely becauſe of late years, <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia</hi> hath ſhaken the yoke of the Kings of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Caſtilia,</hi> and have given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the French; it may be diſputed, whether the French King may uſe any of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:120113:59"/>theſe old ſtale Titles, or whether he muſt ground the juſtice of his poſſeſſion upon the donation which the <hi>Catalans</hi> have made to him, holding themſelves free from the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Spaniard, by reaſon of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction of their priviledges. Certainly in all particular Treaties, the unobſervation of the conditions, freeth the parties from the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the contract. But as for Soveraignties, and the mutual obligations of Kings and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, many will reaſon otherwiſe; ſaying, that although the obligation be mutual as for the conſcience; yet as for the retroceſſion and the penalty attending the breach of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, it doth not reach to Kings, whoſe actions are not cenſurable by the people; not by the nature of the contract which is mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and reciprocall, but for the danger of the conſequence which might authorize revolts. Others alſo will ſay, that a Country giving her ſelfe to a Prince, what priviledges ſoever the people reſerve to themſelves by contract, they are all loſt when they enter into ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, which by its nature makes a man ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to another man without any exception, when the publique good is concerned; &amp; that thoſe priviledges by that ſubjection, paſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the nature of meer liberties and conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Princes, which they may ſtretch, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh, and over-throw, according to their
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:120113:59"/>diſcretion. Certainly in all theſe contentions between the people, and the Soveraign paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and intereſts bear a great ſway, &amp; make conſcience plead on both ſides. But any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will paſſe when there is ſtrength to back it.</p>

                     <p>But upon <hi>Rouſſillon,</hi> the French have a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle altogether ſingular. <hi>John King of Arragon,</hi> that lived in the time of <hi>Lewis the</hi> XI. <hi>of France,</hi> being in War with his ſubjects of <hi>Arragon and Catalonia,</hi> as maintainers of his Son, <hi>Charles Prince of Vienna,</hi> and the true Heir of <hi>Navarra</hi> againſt him, and finding his Subjects too hard for him, as aſſiſted by <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> King of <hi>Caſtilia;</hi> deſired <hi>Lewis the</hi> XI. to aſſiſt him, which he did with great might, having ſent him a good Army under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Charles d' Armagnac,</hi> Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</hi> who confirmed the Crown to <hi>John,</hi> and compoſed the difference between him and his Subjects.

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:120113:61"/>of him. <hi>Lewis,</hi> notwithſtanding many treacheries and attempts of the <hi>Arrogeneſe,</hi> maintained himſelf in that Country, and <hi>Charles the</hi> VIII. his Son after him, untill the deſign of the Conqueſt of <hi>Naples.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was in the year 1492. that <hi>Charles the</hi> VIII. began the enterpriſe of <hi>Naples.</hi> And fearing leaſt <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> Son to that <hi>John</hi> would aſsiſt the houſe of <hi>Naples,</hi> which was a branch of that of <hi>Arragon;</hi> or ſhould enter into <hi>France</hi> in his abſence, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned unto him that County of <hi>Rouſſillon, gratis;</hi> not quitting, but not demanding the three hundred thouſand Crowns; the King of <hi>Arragon</hi> having promiſt, and ſworn upon the holy Croſſe, and upon the Goſpels, that hee would ſerve the King againſt all his Enemies in that expedition of <hi>Italy.</hi> The Governour of <hi>Perpignan</hi> did not yield, but after many iterated commands, ſeeing the importance of that reſtitution, and fearing the infidelity of <hi>Arragon.</hi> The French Hiſtorians blame <hi>James Maillert,</hi> a Franciſcan Frier, Confeſſour to <hi>Charles the</hi> VIII. ſaying, he was won by <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> to perſwade the King to that reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But <hi>Ferdinand</hi> inſtead of helping <hi>Charles</hi> in his expedition of <hi>Italy,</hi> helped his Enemies in <hi>Italy,</hi> and diſturbed his enterpriſe of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi> Since which time, the French have often redemanded that County, as not redeemed

                     <p>Not long after, the Saracens invaded <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</hi> The height of their fury, was about the year 850. and in the parts about <hi>Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> it ſelf, where they ſetled themſelves.

                     <p n="2">2.

                     <p n="3">3.

                     <p n="4">4. But as for the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> that French Family of <hi>Charles d' Anjou,</hi> was ſetled in it, from the year 1264. untill the death of <hi>Jane</hi> the II, <hi>An.</hi> 1435. in all 171. yeares,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:120113:64"/>We intend not to relate that Hiſtory, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to obſerve theſe things which concern our preſent purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that <hi>Charles the Lame,</hi> the ſecond King and Son to that firſt <hi>Charles,</hi> married <hi>Mary,</hi> inheritrice of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and ſo theſe two Kingdomes were united. Of their Children, the eldeſt <hi>Charles,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Martel,</hi> had <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> for his portion, and from him ſome Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Hungary</hi> are deſcended. The ſecond Son was <hi>Lewis,</hi> who would be a Franciſcan Fryer, and was Biſhop of <hi>Toulouſe.</hi> The third Sonne <hi>Robert,</hi> inherited the Kingdome of <hi>Naples.</hi> There were more brothers who had ſeverall <hi>apanages.</hi> But it was not this <hi>Robert</hi> that continued the line of the Kings of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi> He was Father to Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> who dying before his Father, left a Daughter, that famous, or rather infamous, <hi>Queen Jane the Firſt,</hi> that ruled that State almoſt forty years.</p>
                     <p>Next, it muſt be known that this wicked <hi>Jane,</hi> laſcivious and cruel, ſo farre as to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle her Husband <hi>Andrew,</hi> a young Prince of that other Branch of <hi>Hungary,</hi> filled her Kingdome with great troubles by her wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe. Towards the end of her reigne, <hi>an.</hi> 1378. hapned the great Schiſme of the Church, when <hi>Urban</hi> the VI, being made Pope by violence, many Cardinals elected in his ſtead, <hi>Robert</hi> Cardinall of <hi>Geneva,</hi> who
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:120113:64"/>took the name of <hi>Clement</hi> the VII, Queen <hi>Jane</hi> being an enemy to <hi>Urban,</hi> who was born her ſubject, declared her ſelf for <hi>Clement.</hi> Her crim whereby ſhe had put her Husband to death, had been long covered by an accomodation made by <hi>Clement</hi> the VI, who appeaſed <hi>Lewis the great,</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> Brother to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew,</hi> whom <hi>Jane</hi> had ſtrangled. But Pope <hi>Urban</hi> the VI, to be avenged of <hi>Jane,</hi> ſtirred again the Houſe of <hi>Hungary</hi> againſt her, and a Prince of that Houſe, named <hi>Charles de Duras,</hi> came and beſieged her in <hi>Caſtello del Ovo</hi> at <hi>Naples,</hi> took her and ſtrangled her, <hi>an.</hi> 1382. in the ſame place, as ſome ſay, where ſhe had ſtrangled her firſt husband.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But the ſame Princeſs ſeeing that <hi>Urban</hi> invited the houſe of <hi>Hungary</hi> to the conqueſt of <hi>Naples,</hi> called to her help King <hi>Charles</hi> the VI, of <hi>France, an.</hi> 1380. by the advice of Pope <hi>Clement.</hi> And by his leave, (for he bore him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for her Soveraign) ſhe adopted <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> brother to <hi>Charles</hi> the V, of <hi>France,</hi> and head of the ſecond houſe of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou.</hi> He was at that time Regent of <hi>France,</hi> in the minority of King <hi>Charles</hi> the VI. From that adoption the French fetch their right in the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> for from the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of that <hi>Lewis,</hi> the French Kings have inherited.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Charles de Duras,</hi> after he had ſtrangled
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:120113:65"/>Queen <hi>Jane,</hi> ſeized upon the Kingdome, and reigned in her ſtead, and after him his two Children; firſt <hi>Ladiſlaus,</hi> whom the French Hiſtorians call <hi>Lancelot,</hi> and <hi>Jane the Second.</hi> They three held the State 53. yeares, from the yeare 1382. till the yeare 1436. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Jane the firſt,</hi> a little afore her death, had adopted <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> that houſe of <hi>Duras</hi> had continuall War with the houſe of <hi>Anjou. Lewis</hi> the I. came to <hi>Naples</hi> and there dyed. <hi>Lewis</hi> the II, his Son, had great Wars with <hi>Ladiſlaus,</hi> and for a time was Maſter of the Kingdome. That <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> being dead without iſſue, <hi>an.</hi> 1414. his ſiſter Queen <hi>Jane the Second,</hi> ſucceeded him, as bad a woman as the firſt <hi>Jane,</hi> for impudicity and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy. She being degraded by the Pope, <hi>Martin</hi> the V: and <hi>Lewis</hi> the III, Grandchild of the firſt <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Anjou,</hi> named by him to reign in her place; ſhe adopted <hi>Alphonſus</hi> King of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> for her Son, with whom that <hi>Lewis</hi> the III, had great Warres, and had ſometimes the better, ſometimes the worſt. But <hi>Jane</hi> being of an inconſtant ſpirit, deſpiſed <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> being altogether govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her favorite <hi>John Carraciolo,</hi> which <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſus</hi> not able to beare, made himſelfe Maſter of the City of <hi>Naples.</hi> Upon which ſhe cancelled her will made in favour of <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> and inſtead of him, adopted <hi>Lewis</hi> the IV.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:120113:65"/>of <hi>Anjou,</hi> who before was her enemy. That adoption made <hi>an.</hi> 1422. is the ſecond ground of the claime of the French to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and the ſeed of ſo many Wars and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, and of the greateſt diviſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Houſes of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> maintaining the firſt adoption as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, becauſe <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> though accuſed by <hi>Jane</hi> of ungratefulneſſe, upon which ſhe ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the diſanulling of his adoption, did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (as they ſay) againſt the reſpect due to his adoptive Mother; but onely went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to repreſſe the extravagancies of that light-brained woman, to have that part in her affaires which by right belonged to him, and eſpecially curb the inſolency of <hi>Carraciolo,</hi> who kept a ſcandalous familiarity with that woman. The French ſay, that the ſecond adoption is of more validity: That the cauſe of ungratefulneſſe is ſufficient to break an adoption: That <hi>Alphonſus</hi> miſuſed his adoptive Mother, ſeized upon the City of <hi>Naples,</hi> beſieged her, and kept her ſhut up, and did all acts of Soveraign, to her contempt and diſgrace.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. This <hi>Lewis</hi> the IV. Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving recovered <hi>Naples,</hi> enjoyed it with ſome peace together with <hi>Jane,</hi> but dyed before her, <hi>an.</hi> 1434. Becauſe he left no iſſue, ſhe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted his Brother <hi>René</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:120113:66"/>her ſelfe ſoon after dyed. But <hi>René</hi> being then kept priſoner by the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> he could not go to receive his inheritance. His wife <hi>Elizabeth</hi> went, but too late, though at the firſt ſhe got ſome advantage. In the end <hi>Alphonſus</hi> remained Maſter, and the party of <hi>Anjou</hi> was quite expelled out of the Land. Onely <hi>René</hi> kept the poſſeſſion of <hi>Provence,</hi> which was an appurtenance of that State: for ſince the firſt adoption of <hi>Lewis</hi> the I, Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> by Queen <hi>Jane</hi> the I. that ſecond houſe of <hi>Anjou,</hi> had kept the poſſeſſion of <hi>Provence.</hi> Neither did <hi>Charles de Duras,</hi> nor his Children, nor <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> poſſeſs any thing in it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>René</hi> dying <hi>an.</hi> 1480. although his Daughter <hi>Yoland</hi> Dutcheſſe of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> had left children, he left the inheritance of the County of <hi>Provence,</hi> and of his Rights upon <hi>Naples. Charles Count du Maine,</hi> Son to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſame name and title. And <hi>Charles</hi> dying likewiſe without iſſue, left <hi>Lewis</hi> the XI, his Heir in all his ſtates, and the Kings of <hi>France</hi> ſucceſſours to <hi>Lewis. Lewis</hi> neglecting to go to <hi>Naples</hi> held by <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> baſtard of that <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> and by his Children, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelfe to hold <hi>Provence.</hi> But his Sonne, <hi>Charles</hi> the VIII. undertook the conqueſt of <hi>Naples, an.</hi> 1493. and after him, <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII, and <hi>Francis</hi> the I.

                     <p n="1">1.

                     <p>After the wrack of the Roman Empire, <hi>an.</hi> 400. all the Countries about the River of <hi>Po,</hi> towards the Alpes were taken by <hi>Theodorick Goth,</hi> and kept by his children, till about the year 550. that they were recovered by <hi>Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farius</hi> and <hi>Narſes,</hi> two Captaines of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Juſtinian.</hi> But ſoon after the ſame Countries were won by the <hi>Oſtrogoths,</hi> Kings of <hi>Italy;</hi> and again by the <hi>Lombards,</hi> who ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a great State there, and maintained it till the time of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> who deſtroyed it, <hi>an.</hi> 774. After which time all the Towns of thoſe parts were Imperial, belonging to whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had the Empire of the Weſt. The houſe of <hi>Charlemagne</hi> being degenerated and having loſt the Empire, after the yeare 900. the Empire was diſputed between the Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and the German Princes for 50 yeares. In the end the Germans having prevailed in the perſon of <hi>Otho</hi> the I; &amp; the Emperors his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours having choſen the ſeat of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in Germany, and being at odds many times with the Popes, their power ſenſibly decayed in <hi>Italy,</hi> and great part of the Towns of <hi>Lombardy</hi> ſlipt out of their Dominion, and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:120113:67"/>choſe to themſelves <hi>Italian</hi> Lords, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours retaining the ſhadow only of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty. Many alſo choſe liberty, &amp; a Popular State, as <hi>Siena. Piſa, Florence, Genoa,</hi> and others. In theſe confuſions the City of <hi>Milan</hi> was uſurped by the <hi>Viſcounts of Angleria,</hi> a ſmall place in the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained themſelvs about ſix hundred years un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that name and quality of Vicounts, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the year 1497. that the Emperour <hi>Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſlaus</hi> (not <hi>Friderick,</hi> as <hi>Gaſſan</hi> ſaith) erected <hi>Milan</hi> into a Dutchy. The firſt Duke was <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leas the</hi> III. who had married <hi>Iſabella</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>John,</hi> King of <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That <hi>Galeas</hi> had three Sons, <hi>John Maria,</hi> that ſucceeded him and died without iſſue, <hi>Philip Maria</hi> that ſucceeded his brother, who likewiſe died without iſſue, leaving a baſtard daughter named <hi>Bona,</hi> married to <hi>Francis Sforza,</hi> a Souldier of Fortune, but a gallant man. <hi>That firſt Duke Galeas,</hi> beſides theſe two Sons had a daughter called <hi>Valentina,</hi> marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Lewis,</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> Son to <hi>Charles the</hi> V. <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> an. 1398. Her Father gave her the County of <hi>Aſt</hi> for her portion, with a Million of Livers wherewith the <hi>County of Blois</hi> was bought, <hi>Chaſteauduro, Soi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſons,</hi> and other Lordſhips. And by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of Matrimony, it was declared, that if the maſculine line of <hi>Galeas</hi> ſhould fail, <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentina</hi>
                        <pb n="132" facs="tcp:120113:68"/>and her children ſhould ſucceed in the Dutchy. It is true that this clauſe had this great defect, that the Dutchy beeing eſtabliſht a maſculine <hi>Fee, Galeas</hi> could not make it fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine without the Emperours leave, which was not demanded, becauſe the Empire was then vacant by the degradation of <hi>Wenceſtaus,</hi> whom the Electors depoſed for his idleneſſe. But it is pretended that the Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> the XIII. who then had his <hi>See</hi> at <hi>Avignon,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved that contract; for that right the Popes challenge in the vacancy of the Empire.</p>
                     <p>Howſoever <hi>John Maria,</hi> and <hi>Philip Maria,</hi> being dead without lawfull iſſue, none had more right to that ſucceſsion then the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Valentina.</hi> But that ſucceſſion fel in the heat of the confuſions of <hi>France,</hi> under <hi>Charles</hi> the VII, when the two Sons of <hi>Valentina, Charls Duke of Orleans,</hi> &amp; <hi>John Count</hi> of <hi>Angou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſme,</hi> were Priſoners in <hi>England,</hi> where the eldeſt remained five and twenty years, and the ſecond well nigh thirty. In that long time it was eaſie for <hi>Francis Sforza,</hi> who had married <hi>Bona</hi> the baſtard, daughter of <hi>Duke Philip Maria,</hi> to make himſelf Maſter of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> of which he procured, and obtained the inveſtiture from the Emperour <hi>Friderick the</hi> IV. This <hi>Francis Sforza</hi> had two Sons, whom he left to the tuition of his brother <hi>Ludovick Sforza,</hi> ſo famous in the Hiſtory of <hi>Milan,</hi>
                        <pb n="133" facs="tcp:120113:68"/>who having made away his pupills, ſeized upon the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Milan,</hi> and was expelled out of it by <hi>Lewis the</hi> XII. <hi>King of France,</hi> and ſince was taken &amp; carried to <hi>Loches,</hi> where he died in Priſon. He left two Sons, <hi>Maximilian,</hi> who was reſtored by the <hi>Switzers,</hi> and ſince taken by <hi>Francis the</hi> I. and died in <hi>France.</hi> His other Son was <hi>Francis Sforza the ſecond,</hi> who died without iſſue, 1534. So that houſe of <hi>Sforza</hi>'s maintained the uſurpation of <hi>Milan</hi> well nigh a hundred years among many wars and diviſions; the lawfull right remaining ſtill in the houſe of <hi>Orleans,</hi> with the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>County of Aſt,</hi> which is part of that Dutchy.</p>
                     <p>But that right could not be proſecuted, 1. In the deſolation of the houſe of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and the great diviſions between that houſe and the houſe of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> 2. In the long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment of the two Princes of <hi>Orleans,</hi> 3. In the great troubles of the State of <hi>France</hi> almoſt all the reign of <hi>Charles the</hi> VII. 4. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Lewis the</hi> XI. had many other buſineſſes all his time. Neither did he love the houſe of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and the Princes of his blood; And of all things he hated the Wars of <hi>Italie,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would never go, neither for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>Naples,</hi> nor for the receiving the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Genoa</hi> that gave her ſelf to him. 5. All the time of <hi>Charles the</hi> VIII, was ſpent in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:120113:69"/>Wars, or in the Conqueſt of <hi>Naples.</hi> And <hi>Lewis the</hi> XII, Grandchild of <hi>Valentina,</hi> come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Crown, <hi>an.</hi> 1498, had no more in the Dutchy, but the County of <hi>Aſt,</hi> the reſt being held by <hi>Ludovick Sforza,</hi> Son to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vader <hi>Francis,</hi> and himſelf invader of the State of his Nephews. But <hi>Lewis</hi> following his right, comes to <hi>Milan,</hi> takes it and expells <hi>Ludovic,</hi> who returning not long after, enters into <hi>Milan,</hi> but there being ſuddenly inveſted by <hi>Lewis,</hi> he is taken, carried into <hi>France,</hi> where he dieth a Priſoner, <hi>Lewis</hi> remaining Maſter of the Dutchy. But becauſe <hi>Ludovic</hi> had two Sons protected in <hi>Germany</hi> by the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> I. <hi>Lewis</hi> to ſtrengthen his right, made meanes to win the Emperours favour, of whom in the end he obtained two inveſtitures of that Dutchy. The one <hi>An.</hi> 1506 for <hi>Lewis</hi> and his children, and lawfull Heirs, and <hi>Lewis</hi> for the acknowledgement of this inveſtiture, paid him ſixty thouſand livers, and promiſt to give him every year a pair of golden ſpurrs at Chriſtmas. Alſo in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture, the excluſion of <hi>Sforza</hi> is preciſely expreſt, and a marriage concluded betweene <hi>Charles</hi> the Grandchild of <hi>Maximilian,</hi> who ſince was the Emperour <hi>Charles the</hi> V. and <hi>Claude</hi> the eldeſt daughter of <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII. which alſo was comprehended in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture. The other was <hi>an.</hi> 1509. wherby
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:120113:69"/>the ſame Emperour confirms the former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture, with a condition of the marriage between <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Claude,</hi> which indeed was not effected, but that hinders not the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of the inveſtiture, which was abſolute, the firſt at leaſt. By vertue of that right, <hi>Lewis</hi> remained poſſeſt of that Dutchy; but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of his reigne, <hi>Maximilian Sfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> was put in poſſeſſion of that Dutchy by the <hi>Switzers,</hi> by the conſent of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Maximilian,</hi> who was diſpleaſed that <hi>Claude,</hi> promiſed to <hi>Charls</hi> his Grandchild, had been married to <hi>Francis,</hi> who after was <hi>Francis the firſt King of France,</hi> which he took for an affront, and this was the firſt ſeed of the jealouſies between the two houſes of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Auſtria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt having regained the Dutchy, and taken <hi>Maximilian,</hi> neglected to do homage to the Emperour; and a while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Charles</hi> having ſucceeded his Grandfather in the Empire, the animoſities grew to a great height betwixt theſe two Princes, and they became implacable, fighting with great might about <hi>Milan,</hi> till that, by the <hi>Treaty of Madrid, Francis the firſt</hi> yielded his right, as we will relate in the next Chapter.</p>
                     <p>To ſum up the pretences of the French upon <hi>Milan;</hi> They are grounded, 1. Upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of marriage of <hi>Valentina,</hi> who is ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:120113:70"/>Heir of the Dutchy, the lawfull Heires male failing; and the contract is valid, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Pope in the vacancy of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. 2.

                     <p>Theſe two Counties were antiently before the conqueſt of the Romans, parts of <hi>Gallia Belgica,</hi> and ſo under that Empire, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the firſt and ſecond race of the French Kings, till that famous partage of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Lewis the Meek,</hi> an. 843. when the River of <hi>Scaldis</hi> being ſet as a limit of that which belonged to <hi>Lothary,</hi> the Emperour on the one ſide; and <hi>Charles le Chauve</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that Country remained within the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the laſt, who was King of <hi>France,</hi> and containes a great extent of Land beyond the River of <hi>Somme,</hi> near the Rivers of <hi>Scaldis</hi> and <hi>Lis,</hi> butting upon the Ocean. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all that Country was full of Wood, which made it be called <hi>Sylva Carbonaria, Charlemagne,</hi> about the yeare 771. placed there a Governour whom he called the <hi>great Foreſter of Flanders.</hi> So alſo were his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors called, and were not very conſiderable.</p>
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:120113:72"/>
                     <p>The firſt that erected this Country into a County, was <hi>Charles le Chauve,</hi> an. 850. or thereabouts. The firſt Count was <hi>Baldwin,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Bras de fer</hi> or <hi>Iron-arm,</hi> for his great exploits againſt the <hi>Normans,</hi> then barbarous and infidels, who coming from the North, infeſted thoſe coaſts both by Sea and Land. This <hi>Baldwin</hi> ſtole away <hi>Iudith</hi> Daughter to <hi>Charles le Chauve,</hi> and widow to an Engliſh King, which action at the firſt moved <hi>Charles</hi> to a great wrath and hatred againſt him. But <hi>Iudith</hi> having appeaſed her Father, and <hi>Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> being very neceſſary for the defence of thoſe Countries againſt the Normans, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the Kings Grace, and it was upon that reconciliation, that he was made Count of <hi>Flanders.</hi> So that <hi>Baldwin</hi> is the head of that houſe of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Artois,</hi> which then were but one Province.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. All that Country remained thus united in one County, till the year 1180. when <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip Auguſt</hi> King of France, married <hi>Iſabella</hi> Daughter of <hi>Baldwin</hi> the IV. Count of <hi>Hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naut</hi> and <hi>Namur,</hi> and of <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Flanders.</hi> For <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Alſatia,</hi> Count of <hi>Flanders,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to <hi>Margaret,</hi> to ſhew his joy for that high alliance, gave her the Country of <hi>Artois,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the Towns of <hi>Arras, Bapaume,</hi> Saint <hi>Omer, Aire, Heſdin,</hi> and ſome others which <hi>Philip Auguſt</hi> enjoyed, and his Sons after him,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:120113:72"/>till <hi>Lewis</hi> the VIII, gave the Country of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tois</hi> to his third Son <hi>Robert,</hi> for whoſe ſake his brother St <hi>Lewis</hi> erected the ſame into a County, of which this <hi>Robert</hi> did him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and that houſe of <hi>Artois</hi> was a Royal houſe for a long time after. Thus <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Artois</hi> had their ſeverall Counts and Lords, as moſt of the other ſeventeen Provinces of <hi>Netherlands.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>King Iohn</hi> of France having given to his fourth Son <hi>Philip,</hi> the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> becauſe he loved him dearly, he procured a great marriage for him, matching him with <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Flanders,</hi> only Daughter of <hi>Lewis</hi> the III. Count of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and of <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Brabant.</hi> That Princeſs was held the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt match of Europe, for ſhe was Heir not onely of the Counties of <hi>Flanders, Burgundy, Artois, Nevers, Retel,</hi> and other great Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, but was alſo apparent Heir (from her great Aunt by her Mothers ſide) of the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies of <hi>Brabant, Lothier, Limburg,</hi> and the <hi>Marqueſat</hi> of <hi>Antwerp.</hi> That alliance made an. 1356. was the beginning of the greatneſs of the houſe of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> For that <hi>Philip,</hi> and his three ſucceſſors, <hi>Iohn, Philip,</hi> and <hi>Charles,</hi> united all theſe great States, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards fell into the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, as we have repreſented before.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Although the propriety of thoſe two
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:120113:73"/>Provinces, <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Artois,</hi> came to the Houſe of <hi>Austria</hi> by the match of <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Burgundy</hi> with <hi>Maximilian;</hi> the pretences of the Crowne of <hi>France</hi> upon that propriety, being quitted by the reddition of the Towne of <hi>Arras, an.</hi> 1435. Yet the ſoveraignty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hath remained with the French Kings, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Ceſſions by them made of the ſame by ſeverall Treaties, of which the firſt was that of <hi>Madrid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That ſoveraignty is proved by ſeven Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. The firſt is, The homages which the Counts have alwaies payed to the Kings of <hi>France</hi> for theſe Counties, and the inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which they have taken from them of the ſame. The ſecond, That the Kings of France have judged of the Counts of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> as Soveraigns, and given them Lawes. The third, that they decided of peace and war in <hi>Flanders,</hi> even againſt the will of the Counts. The fourth, That they have given grace to <hi>Flemmings</hi> as their Soveraigns, and puniſht them of their rebellions. The fifth, That it was eſpecially promis'd and agreed, that the Flemmings ſhould reſort to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>Paris.</hi> The ſixth, That the Kings of France have protected as Soveraignes, the <hi>Counts of Flanders.</hi> The ſeventh, That they have confiſcated the County for Felony. Briefly, the Kings of France have exer ciſed
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:120113:73"/>all Acts of Soveraignty in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tois,</hi> a thing never brought in queſtion or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed before <hi>Charles</hi> the V. who being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted to the Empire, and fallen to great Wars againſt <hi>Francis</hi> the I. was delinquent in that duty, and obtained the ceſſion of that right by divers Treaties.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is then a known truth, that <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Artois</hi> did belong to the Soveraignty of <hi>France,</hi> and that the queſtion is onely, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ceſſion made at <hi>Madrid</hi> was juſt and valid. Upon which the French ſay,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That <hi>Charles</hi> the V, being born a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of France at <hi>Gant,</hi> in the County of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> committed the crime of Felony by his Wars againſt his Soveraign, whom alſo he took and kept priſoner, which was often up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided to him; yea a ſentence of the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Paris,</hi> intervened againſt him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is deprived of his Lordſhips depending of the Crown of Ftance for crime of Felony; ſo that being a Felon againſt his Soveraigne, he had no right either to treat with him when he kept him priſoner, nor any way oblige him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ceſſion made by the Treaty of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> was invalid by the Law of Nations, as done by a man kept in priſon.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That ceſſion made at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Treaties, is null by the fundamentall
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:120113:74"/>Laws of <hi>France</hi> which prohibit the alienati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Soveraign rights of the Crown, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially without the conſent of the States Generall, who never ratified all thoſe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And in effect, the Parliaments by their ſentences, the Peers of the Kingdom by their Votes, and all the learned and judicious by their diſcourſes have condemned thoſe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And to this day the <hi>Flemmings and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> are accounted <hi>Regnicolae,</hi> and have no need of letters of Naturalization.</p>

               <p>WE have ſeen how by the Hiſtory, and by Reaſon, the two Houſes of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Auſtria</hi> will ground their ſeveral preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. As the differences between private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons beget ſuits in Law, which end in the ſentence of a Court; ſo the jealouſies between theſe two great houſes have begot Wars, which haue ended in Treaties: Yet ſo that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:120113:74"/>the Wars have begun afreſh after. Theſe Wars have been many, eſpecially ſince the promotion of <hi>Charles</hi> the V to the Empire, <hi>an.</hi> 1519. For the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> who without contradiction had the precedence before all Chriſtian Monarches were grieved to ſee a <hi>Count of Flanders,</hi> and an Heir of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> a ſmall Province of <hi>Germany</hi> advance himſelf ſo far as to offer to ſtep before them, and (as many think) to affect the Empire of all <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To underſtand all theſe Wars, Truces, and Treaties; the Hiſtory muſt begin at the <hi>Treaty of Arras, an.</hi> 1435.

                  <p>In all that time, which was not yet the time of the greatneſſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> the French Kings had nothing to do with that Family, which in that period of years, enjoyed the Empire in the perſons of <hi>Albert,</hi> and <hi>Fride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick the</hi> III. They had alſo little to do with the Kings of <hi>Caſtilia and Arragon,</hi> which were then two ſeverall States. But much they had to do with the Dukes of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of that greatneſſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> Of which this is the ſummary.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Philip le Bon</hi> after he had brought the State of <hi>France</hi> into great diſtreſſe, and given
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:120113:75"/>it for a prey to the Engliſh, to avenge the death of his Father <hi>John,</hi> ſlain at <hi>Montereau Fautyonne,</hi> an. 1419; Finally being ill ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Engliſh, was forced to agree with <hi>Charls the</hi> VII, who had killed his Father, which he did by the Treaty of <hi>Arras, an.</hi> 1435. whereby <hi>Charles</hi> gave to <hi>Philip</hi> what we ſaid before, <hi>Peronne, Montdidier,</hi> and <hi>Roye,</hi> the <hi>County of Artois,</hi> the enjoying of the <hi>County of Bullen</hi> for his life, alſo all the Towns of the River of <hi>Somme,</hi> redeemable with four hundred thouſand Crownes, and promiſt to join to the <hi>Dutchy of Burgundy,</hi> the Counties of <hi>Maſcon, Chalons, Langres, Bar ſur Siene,</hi> and <hi>Auxerre</hi> for ever, reſerving the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort of theſe juriſdictions to the Parliament of <hi>Paris.</hi> This Treaty raiſed very much the houſe of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> After which, <hi>Philip</hi> was a loyall friend and ſervant unto <hi>Charles,</hi> and helped him to expell the Engliſh out of <hi>France.</hi> Neither did he meddle with the firſt falling out of <hi>Charles</hi> with his Son <hi>Lewis the Dolphin</hi> (who was ſince <hi>Lewis</hi> the XI.) which diviſion was called, <hi>La Ligue de la Praguerie.</hi> And all the reigne of Charles nothing confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable hapned between theſe two houſes but that towards the end of <hi>Charles, Lewis the Dolphin,</hi> having withdrawn himſelf diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented from the Court, and lived a while in <hi>Daulphiné,</hi> When the King his Father would
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:120113:76"/>have apprehended him by the <hi>Count of Damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martin,</hi> he fled into <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he was received with great honour by <hi>Duke Philip,</hi> who aſſigned him the Town of <hi>Guenep</hi> in <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant,</hi> to keep his Court, where he lived ſix or ſeaven years, till the death of his Father, <hi>an.</hi> 1461.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Now comes the reign of <hi>Lewis the</hi> XI, who had ſo much to do with the houſe of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> but nothing with that of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and little with that of <hi>Arragon and Caſtilia.</hi> Hiſtorians obſerve, that <hi>Philip Duke of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi> and his Son <hi>Charles Count of Charrolois</hi> accompanied <hi>Lewis</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> and were preſent at his coronation. And that <hi>Lewis</hi> at the firſt was very great with the <hi>Count of Charrolois;</hi> but that ſoon after that friendſhip was ſeparated, by reaſon of the great antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of their humours, and becauſe while <hi>Lewis</hi> was retired into <hi>Flanders,</hi> they had been too much acquainted with one anothers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, which brought them to a mutuall contempt. Alſo, becauſe <hi>Charles</hi> had a ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion that <hi>Lewis</hi> had plotted againſt his life, and becauſe <hi>Lewis</hi> would have brought the <hi>Gabell</hi> (or impoſt of ſalt) into <hi>Burgundy,</hi> which the Duke did oppoſe. Then the ſuddain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming of the Towns of the River of <hi>Somme,</hi> for which <hi>Lewis</hi> payed the four hundred thouſand Crowns, incens'd the <hi>Count of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolois</hi>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:120113:76"/>very much. Theſe were the cauſes of the great hatred between theſe two houſes, which the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> inherited together with the Eſtate. Hardly indeed could theſe two Princes agree; for <hi>Lewis</hi> the XI was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, diſobliging, and diſſembled; and <hi>Charles</hi> Count of <hi>Charolois</hi> was peeviſh and arrogant, and followed no Law but his own will. That hatred brought forth the War of the <hi>publick good,</hi> as they called it, in which <hi>Charles</hi> had the better. That War ended in the <hi>Treaty of Conflans,</hi> whereby it was cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted that the King ſhould reſtore to <hi>Charles</hi> all the Towns of the River of <hi>Somme,</hi> redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not long before, to enjoy them all his life, and that he ſhould have the <hi>County of Guines</hi> for himſelf and his Heirs for ever.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Arragon;</hi> was aſſiſted by <hi>Lewis</hi> the XI, and the ſaid <hi>John</hi> ſold or pawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him the <hi>County of Rouſſillon</hi> for three hundred thouſand Crownes. This is the ground of the claime of the French to that County.</p>

                     <hi>France.</hi> That enterview made them deſpiſe one another, for <hi>Henry</hi> was an ill favoured and ill behaved man, of little wit, and was altogether governed by the <hi>Count of Lodeſme.

The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the <hi>Count of Lodeſme</hi> ſeemed ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to the French.

                  <p n="6">6. This new Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> is much conſidered in <hi>France,</hi> by reaſon of his great Lands, and turbulent ſpirit.

                     <p>In the beginning of his reign, he found the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> in the hands of <hi>Charles,</hi> then of the age of fifteen years, who poſſeſt all the <hi>Low Countries</hi> by his Father <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and the Kingdom of <hi>Caſtilia</hi> from his Mother <hi>Jane</hi> of <hi>Arragon. Maximilian</hi> was yet living, enjoying the Arch-dutchy of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> His o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Grand-father, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was King of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> both very old and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:120113:83"/>
                        <hi>Charles</hi> was their Heir apparent.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Francis</hi> the I. comming to the Crown, received the homage of the Count of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> in the name of <hi>Charles,</hi> Count of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Artois,</hi> to whom he promiſt <hi>Renee,</hi> ſecond daughter to <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII. But that marriage was not fulfilled. Hee confirmed alſo that peace with <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> which <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII. had made a little before he died.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. His next work, was the Conqueſt of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan.</hi> He paſſeth into <hi>Italie,</hi> and wins the battail of <hi>Marignan in Piemont</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Switzers,</hi> who had undertaken to maintain <hi>Maximilian Sforza</hi> in his new poſſeſſion of <hi>Milan,</hi> which they had got for him. He gets <hi>Milan. Maximilian Sforza</hi> yields himſelf to him for a Penſion of threeſcore thouſand Crowns, and retires himſelf into <hi>France.</hi> This was the third time that the French had got <hi>Milan</hi> of the <hi>Sforzas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Francis</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> being both young, and ambitious, it could not be expected that they ſhould long live in peace, becauſe <hi>Charles</hi> being born a ſubject to <hi>France,</hi> kept <hi>Navarra,</hi> which the houſe of <hi>Albret</hi> had loſt for adhering to <hi>France;</hi> Then <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had expelled the French out of <hi>Naples,</hi> wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſay they. This <hi>Ferdinand</hi> died <hi>an.</hi> 1516. and <hi>Charles</hi> inherited all theſe great States, exalted to the height of greatneſſe, wanting
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:120113:83"/>nothing but the Empire and <hi>Auſtria,</hi> which his Grandfather <hi>Maximilian</hi> left him by his death three years after. In the birth of theſe two eminent powers, which have coſt ſo much, blood and tears to the Chriſtian world, before they had conceived that great hatred which was between them after; the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of both ſides met at <hi>Noyon,</hi> and this was called the <hi>Treaty of Noyon, an.</hi> 1516, where it was concluded, that <hi>Francis</hi> ſhould yield all his rights in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> for a yearly penſion of a hundred thouſand Crowns. 2. That <hi>Charls</hi> then called the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke, ſhould marry <hi>Loviſe,</hi> the eldeſt daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Francis,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Renee,</hi> ſiſter to the Queen <hi>Claude.</hi> 3. That the Archduke ſhould reſtore the Kingdome of <hi>Navarra</hi> to <hi>Henry,</hi> Son to <hi>John d' Albret,</hi> or in defect of it that he ſhould otherwiſe content him within ſix months. The <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Archduke</hi> ſwore that Treaty, and give the one to the other, the order of Knighthood. The King that of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> the Archduke that of the <hi>Golden Fleece,</hi> made an alliance for ever; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it, promiſt to have an interview at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray.</hi> But <hi>Ferdinand</hi> being dead ſoon after, <hi>Charles</hi> made haſt to paſſe into <hi>Spain</hi> to take poſſeſſion of his Eſtates, and neglected the Articles of <hi>Noyon,</hi> eſpecially the reſtitution of <hi>Navarra.</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. Yet for three years after, nothing was ſtirred on either ſide, becauſe <hi>Martin Luther</hi> having alarmed all <hi>Europe</hi> with his Doctrine, the Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the X procured a generall truce for five years among all Princes. But <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian</hi> the Emperonr being dead, <hi>an.</hi> 1519. and <hi>Charles</hi> being increaſed with the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and the Title of Emperour; <hi>Francis</hi> the I. conceived a great indignation, that a vaſſall of his ſhould have been prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before him to the Empire, which he had been a ſuitour for with great earneſtneſſe; which jealouſie would never ſuffer theſe two Princes to agree.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Each of them had a great Miniſter of State by their perſons, <hi>Francis</hi> had <hi>Artus Gouffier, Sieur de Boiſſi,</hi> Great Maſter of <hi>France.

                  <p>By the death of the Emperour <hi>Maximili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Charles</hi> was made poſſeſſour of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and the <hi>Empire,</hi> being poſſeſt before of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances of <hi>Burgundy, Arragon, and Caſtilia.</hi> A greatneſſe which ſwelled his mind, and made him looſe his reſpect to <hi>Francis.</hi> Hee complained that <hi>Francis</hi> had taken <hi>Claude</hi> from him, the eldeſt daughter of <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII, which was promiſt to him. <hi>Francis</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demanded <hi>Navarra, Naples,</hi> and the homages for the Counties of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Artois,</hi> which <hi>Charles</hi> took to be too low for the quality of an <hi>Emperour. Charles</hi> alſo complained that the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> the Patrimony of his Grandmother <hi>Mary</hi> was kept from him, and the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> belonging to the <hi>Sforzas,</hi> and to the Empire.</p>
                  <p>The great fire of War which laſted forty years between theſe two houſes, brake out upon a very ſlender occaſion. <hi>Robert de la March</hi> Duke of <hi>Bovillon,</hi> adjudgd by the Peers of his Dutchy, which pretend themſelves to be Soveraigns, the Town of <hi>Hierges</hi> in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dennes</hi>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:120113:85"/>to the Prince of <hi>Chimay,</hi> of the houſe of <hi>Crovi,</hi> againſt the Lord <hi>d' Eſmeries;</hi> to whom the Emperour gave a writ of relief, although <hi>Robert</hi> pretended the judgement of his Peeres to be Soveraign. <hi>Robert</hi> incenſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Emperonr, made his addreſſe to <hi>Francis</hi> the I, and offered him his ſervice. The King received him courteouſly, yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad his ſubjects to aſſiſt him, not willing to break with the Emperour. But <hi>Robert,</hi> proud to have the protection of <hi>France,</hi> denounceth Warre to the Emperour, who was then at <hi>Wormes</hi> to pacifie the troubles riſing in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> about <hi>Luther,</hi> and attempts to ſurpriſe ſome places in <hi>Luxemburg.</hi> But the Emperour preſently ſeizeth upon the Eſtate of that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Prince, and conſtrains him to ask him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; reproaching <hi>Francis</hi> in an odious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for receiving his rebellious ſubject. About the ſame time, <hi>Francis</hi> upon the inexecution of the Treaty of <hi>Noyon</hi> (<hi>Charles</hi> refuſing to make reſtitution of <hi>Navarra</hi> to <hi>Henry d' Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bret</hi>) took the quarrell of that diſpoſſeſſed Prince, and ſent <hi>Andrew de Foix, Lord de Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parre,</hi> brother to <hi>Monſieur de Lautre</hi> into <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varra,</hi> where the French did ſome exploit at the firſt, but were ſoon repelled by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards. <hi>Charles</hi> taketh that enterpriſe for an infraction of the peace between the two hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, though it was but a ſuccour given to a
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:120113:85"/>confederate of <hi>France,</hi> to proſecute his rights. He makes great preparatives of war, makes <hi>Leo</hi> the X, break w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>France,</hi> &amp; joyn with him promiſing that after the Conqueſt of <hi>Milan,</hi> he would give to the Church the Townes of <hi>Parma and Placentia,</hi> members of that Dutchy, to which the Popes had ſome old pretence.</p>
                  <p>Such was the origine of the firſt War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Francis</hi> and <hi>Charles, an.</hi> 1521. The firſt three or four yeares there were great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits in <hi>Champagne,</hi> in <hi>Navarra,</hi> in <hi>Provence,</hi> and in the Dutchy of <hi>Milan.</hi> In <hi>Tieraſche</hi> the Emperour took <hi>Mouzon,</hi> and beſieged <hi>Mezie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> which <hi>Anne de Mommorency,</hi> who ſince was Conſtable of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Chevalier Bayard</hi> defended bravely. And <hi>Francis</hi> took <hi>Bapaume</hi> and <hi>Landrecy</hi> from the Emperour, and gave him the Chaſe.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Navarra</hi> the French had advanced but little in the years 1519. and 1520. But in the year 1521. the <hi>Admirall of Bonnivet</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged <hi>Fontarabie</hi> and took it, and made <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteur du Lude,</hi> Governour of the ſame, who being beſieged a whole year by the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, defended it with great valour, till <hi>la Paliſſe</hi> ſince Marſhall of <hi>France</hi> made them forſake the Siege. But <hi>Frauget</hi> an old Captain being made Governour inſtead of <hi>Lude,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered it baſely to the Spaniards, for which he was degraded of <hi>Nobility.</hi> With this the French loſt all <hi>Navarra,</hi> and never came into it ſince.</p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:120113:86"/>
                  <p>For <hi>Milan, Francis</hi> having given the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of it to the Conſtable <hi>Charles de Bourbon,</hi> he removed him and gave it to <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,</hi> of the houſe of <hi>Foix,</hi> a great Captain in the field, but an ill Politician in a State. Hee ſo miſuſed the people of <hi>Milan,</hi> both by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and by his brother the Marſhall <hi>de Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cun,</hi> and together was ſo ill aſſiſted with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from the Court, that the Emperour had an eaſie entry into the Country. <hi>Milan</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and plundered by the league of the Pope and the Emperour; and the French expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of the Dutchy. At which they ſay, that the Pope died for joy, <hi>an.</hi> 1621. Soon after the battell of <hi>la Bicoque</hi> was fought, which the <hi>French</hi> loſt by the ſtubborneſſe of the <hi>Switzers. Lautree</hi> being returnd into <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Admiral de Bonnivet</hi> was ſent to <hi>Milan,</hi> where hee did no better, and was forced to forſake all. In that retreat <hi>Chevalier Bayard</hi> was killed, <hi>an.</hi> 1523. Theſe proſperities of the Emperour were much helpt, by the revolt of the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> 1522, who was incenſed by the little account that <hi>Francis</hi> made of him, the incroaching of the Duke of <hi>Alanſon,</hi> and the Marſhall of <hi>Bonivet</hi> upon his Office of Conſtable, by the Kings favour; the hatred of <hi>Loviſe</hi> the Kings mother, and the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour <hi>du Prat</hi> againſt him; and the ſmall juſtice which hee expected in a ſuit which
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:120113:86"/>concerned almoſt his whole Eſtate. Being turned to the Emperours party, he helped him to conquer <hi>Milan,</hi> and to give the chaſe to the <hi>Admiral of Bonivet,</hi> paſt into <hi>Provence</hi> with the Imperiall Army, beſieged <hi>Marſeille,</hi> where he is repulſed by <hi>Renſo de Cera</hi> a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Baron, and <hi>Philip de Chabot</hi> that kept it for the King. He repaſſeth the Alpes, and the King after him, who comming to <hi>Milan,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth preſently the whole Dutchy, <hi>Pavia</hi> only accepted.</p>
                  <p>While <hi>Francis</hi> is beſieging <hi>Pavia</hi> defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Antonio de Leva, Charles de Bourbon</hi> brings Troops out of <hi>Germany</hi> to relieve it. The battell of <hi>Pavia</hi> is fought, where the victory being already on the Kings ſide, he would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in perſon the Enemy which was retiring, and had no ſooner overtaken them, but hee was taken by them, <hi>an.</hi> 1524. upon Saint <hi>Mathias</hi> day. <hi>Francis</hi> having been kept a while in the Caſtle of <hi>Piſſigi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

This brought forth the Treaty of <hi>Madrid, an.</hi> 1525, where <hi>Gatinara</hi> Chancellour to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and <hi>John de Selva</hi> firſt Preſident of <hi>Paris,</hi> who were the two learned among the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, diſputed at ſeverall times the rights of their Maſters. <hi>Selva</hi> claimed <hi>Naples, Navarra,</hi> and the Soverainties of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Artois.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:120113:87"/>Gatinara</hi> claimed the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> which the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour then poſſeſt. In the end, the Treaty of <hi>Madrid</hi> was made, where among other things it was concluded <hi>Febr.</hi> 14. 1525,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That within the 20. day of the month of <hi>June</hi> next, the King will put the Durchy of <hi>Burgundy</hi> into the Emperours hands, with all the appurtenances and dependances thereof, and all that he holds of the <hi>Franch County.</hi>

                  <p>That period containes but four or five years, in which many conſiderable things did happen.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The King is delivered out of priſon, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his two Sons for Oſtages, the <hi>Dolphin Francis,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> goeth to <hi>Bayonne</hi> and <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> ſtayeth at <hi>Angou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſme</hi> and <hi>Cognae,</hi> accompanied with <hi>Charles de Lanoy,</hi> Viceroy of <hi>Naples,</hi> to be preſent at the execution of the Treaty. But that Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy ſaw in ſhort time three actions repugnant unto it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt that the King having cauſed the Articles to be read in preſence of the States of his Kingdom, they told him that they were unjuſt, contrary to the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Lawes of the State; and that he was not obliged to obſerve them, although the King did proteſt of his willingneſſe to ſee them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
                  <p>Two things made theſe Articles unjuſt; 1. The right of Nations, whereby all Treaties made by one kept in priſon, are accounted void as extorted by violence. 2. The funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:120113:88"/>Lawes of the State, by which the King is alwayes a <hi>Minor,</hi> as for the alienation of the royal patrimony.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond oppoſition to the Treaty in the preſence of the Viceroy of <hi>Naples,</hi> was that the Deputies of the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted before the King, that he could not alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate them without their conſent, and refuſed to ſubmit themſelves to the Emperour.</p>
                  <p>The third, That he ſaw a league made at <hi>Cognac,</hi> for the expelling of the Emperour out of <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Emperour having made himſelfe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable to all Princes, to the <hi>Italians</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and going about to deveſt <hi>Franceſco Sfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> from <hi>Milan,</hi> which he had conferred upon him after the battel of <hi>Pavia,</hi> the Pope <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the VII, King <hi>Francis,</hi> the <hi>Venetians,</hi> the <hi>Switzers,</hi> the <hi>Florentines,</hi> make a league which was called the <hi>Sacred league,</hi> to deliver <hi>Italy</hi> from oppreſſion, without naming the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, who alſo in a ſcorn was invited to make one in it, upon condition that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the two Sons of France, ſuffer the Duke <hi>Sforza</hi> to live in peace, and give over the ſiege of the Caſtle of <hi>Milan.</hi> By that league the War was to be maintained with common charges. And becauſe the Italian Princes might be afraid of the power of the French in Italy, no leſſe then of that of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:120113:88"/>King <hi>Francis</hi> was to renounce his right to the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> in favour of <hi>Sforza,</hi> for a penſion which ſhould be arbitrated by the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> not under fifty thouſand Ducats. That the County of <hi>Aſt</hi> ſhould remaine to the King, with the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of <hi>Genoa,</hi> under the Government of <hi>Antonio d' Adornas,</hi> with the title of Duke, if he would ſubſcribe to that league. The Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> was to be put into the Popes hands, he paying for it ſixty thouſand Ducats of yearly penſion. That league was publiſht and proclaimed at <hi>Cognac,</hi> in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of <hi>Lanoy,</hi> to whom the King made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes for the inexecution of the Treaty of <hi>Madrid,</hi> ſhewing how he was diſabled and declared <hi>Minor</hi> by the State.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Lanoy</hi> being returned into Spain, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the War of the league begins in Italy, at <hi>Milan,</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and at <hi>Naples.</hi> At <hi>Milan,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bourbon</hi> Generall of the imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Army, beſieged <hi>Francis Sforza,</hi> whom the league had taken in her protection. <hi>Sforza</hi> is conſtrained to ſurrender the Caſtle and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire into the Army of the league, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall whereof was <hi>Franceſco Maria,</hi> Duke of <hi>Urbin.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Bourbon</hi> having taken <hi>Milan,</hi> goeth ſtraight to <hi>Rome,</hi> takes it, and is killed in the aſſault. The Cardinalls are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned and ranſomed.</p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:120113:89"/>
                  <p>At the ſame time <hi>Lautree</hi> was at <hi>Naples</hi> with an Army, and laid a ſtrait ſiege to it by Land. And <hi>Andrew Doria</hi> with the Gallies of France beſieged it by Sea. Yea, he won a battel by Sea, in which <hi>Moncado</hi> Viceroy of <hi>Naples</hi> was ſlaine. But being ill ſatisfied of King <hi>Francis,</hi> who denyed him the ranſome of Priſoners, and uſed him with contempt, he turned to the Emperour, and relieved <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> with victualls by Sea. And <hi>Lautree</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after happening to die, the French loſt all in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Emperour ſettled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in it with more power. He reſtored the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> to <hi>Sforza,</hi> and made him marry his neece <hi>Christina,</hi> daughter to the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi> Yet he cut off from that Dutchy the Commonwealth of <hi>Genoa,</hi> which was made Soveraign at the requeſt of <hi>Andrew Doria.</hi> He confirmed alſo <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Placen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> to the Popes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. While this War was in <hi>Italy,</hi> King <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> made a league with <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. of <hi>England,</hi> and both declared War againſt the Emperour, who having ſaid to the Herald of France, that his Maſter was not in a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to declare Warre againſt him, till he had diſingaged his faith and fulfilled his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which if he repented of, that he ſhould return into priſon to make a new Treaty.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Francis</hi> exaſperated with theſe words,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:120113:89"/>declared in preſence of all the Court, that he would ſatisfie the Emperour by a Duel, and ſent him a challenge, ſaying, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour lied, if he ſaid that he had broken his word. The Emperour, though he made a ſhew to anſwer the challenge, kept himſelf ſtill to his anſwer, that King <hi>Francis</hi> was not in a condition to require ſatisfaction of him, till he had diſcharged his promiſe. So all theſe threatnings vaniſht into ſmoak.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. While theſe Princes were thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, two great Princeſſes, <hi>Loviſe</hi> the Kings Mother, and <hi>Margaret</hi> the Emperours Aunt, were labouring for an accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. By their meanes the Treaty of <hi>Cambray</hi> was made, which therefore was called the Treaty <hi>of Ladies,</hi> it was in the year 1529. By that Treaty a marriage was concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween King <hi>Francis</hi> and <hi>Eleanor</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours ſiſter, widow to the King of <hi>Portugal;</hi> and it was agreed that King <hi>Francis</hi> ſhould pay two millions of Gold for the ranſome of his Sons. And that he ſhould diſclaim all his rights to the Counties of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Artois,</hi> and to the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> and (as ſome adde) to whole <hi>Italy,</hi> which is like enough, ſince the Treaty of <hi>Cambray</hi> changed nothing in that of <hi>Madrid,</hi> but that there was no mention of the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy.</hi>

                  <p>By the Treaty of <hi>Cambray,</hi> War ceaſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two Princes, but not the jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and hatred: Yet they kept peace till the year 1533. when <hi>Merville</hi> an Italian Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the Kings ſervant, was condemned and executed at <hi>Milan,</hi> becauſe ſome of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants had killed a man. But the ſecret and true reaſon was, that the Emperour had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to Duke <hi>Sforza,</hi> that this <hi>Merville</hi> was at <hi>Milan</hi> as a Spy for the French, which was true; yea he was a ſecret Embaſſadour, and <hi>Sforza</hi> had deſired that he ſhould not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly take the title of Embaſſadour, for fear of offending the Emperour. That murther of <hi>Merville</hi> broke the peace; for the King ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Armes to chaſtiſe <hi>Sforza,</hi> the Emperour alſo took arms to defend him. It was at that time that King <hi>Francis</hi> inſtituted a new form of Militia, which was called <hi>Legionary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Emperour alſo was incenſed by the alliance which the King had made with the German Princes Proteſtant (though perhaps that name was not yet in faſhion) who being perſecuted by the Emperour for their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:120113:90"/>had their refuge to the French King, as the antient confederate of the Princes of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> for the defence of the Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Empire. Theſe Princes were the Dukes of <hi>Saxony, the Palatine, the Duke of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier, the Duke of Wertenberg, the Lantgrave of Heſſe.</hi> Yea, he lent a hundred thouſand Crowns to the Duke of <hi>Virtenberg,</hi> who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to him the County of <hi>Montbeliard.</hi> But that engagement was ſimulate, and <hi>Francis</hi> did very willingly aſſiſt the Enemies of <hi>Charles.</hi> Theſe were the motives and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this War. Of which, theſe were the chief paſſages.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Francis</hi> to paſſe to <hi>Milan,</hi> demands of <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> paſſage through his Country. The Duke denies it by the inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Beatrix of Portugal</hi> his wife, ſiſter in law to the Emperor, &amp; very partial for him. That deniall coſt the <hi>Duke</hi> the loſſe of all his Lands, both of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Fiemont,</hi> which the King took, and kept them till the Treaty of <hi>Chaſteau</hi> in <hi>Cambreſis,</hi> an. 1559. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of that invaſion was the right which <hi>Francis</hi> pretended in theſe States from his Mother <hi>Loviſe</hi> of <hi>Ravoy.</hi> A little before that invaſion, the Emperour ſeeing that thick cloud threatning <hi>Milan,</hi> himſelf returning from <hi>Tunis</hi> with a weary and broken Army, ſends to the <hi>K.</hi> propoſitions of peace, &amp; many
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:120113:91"/>fair words. Yet he ſtood ſo ſtiffely upon the Treaties before, very advantageous for him, that the King would not hearken to him, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that ne would only protract the time till he had recrewted his Army. Beſides <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Sforza</hi> being dead without children, at the ſame time the Emperour had ſeized upon the Dutchy of <hi>Milan.</hi> And it was reported, that he intended to beſtow it upon a Sonne of <hi>Portugal,</hi> his wives brother. For theſe reaſons theſe two Princes fall to action. The King conquereth <hi>Savoy and Piemont,</hi> and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour fortifies himſelf at <hi>Milan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Emperour paſſeth into <hi>Italy,</hi> viſits the <hi>Pope, Paul</hi> III, an. 1536, and in prefence of the <hi>Conclave,</hi> inveighs againſt <hi>Francis,</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all that paſt between them ever ſince they came to their States, reproaching him eſpecially for joining with the Princes of contrary Religion in <hi>Germany:</hi> And offereth three conditions to the King to chooſe which he would. The firſt was to give the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> to the Kings third Son, the <hi>Duke of Angouleſme,</hi> not willing to give it either to the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> or to the <hi>Duke of Orleans,</hi> for fear (ſaid he) of giving jealouſie to the Italian Princes, if perſons ſo near the Crown grew ſo powerfull in <hi>Italy,</hi> eſpecially the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who had lately married <hi>Catherine de Medicis,</hi> which had ſome pretences upon
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:120113:91"/>
                     <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Urbin.</hi> If the King accepted that condition, he deſired to know what aſſiſtance he would give him againſt the Turk and the Heretiques. The Emperours ſecond offer was, to fight a Duell with the King, either upon the Land or in a Boat. That he left to the King the choice of the Armes; That the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed ſhould give all his forces to ſecure the ſitting of a Council, and to make War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Heretiques and Infidells. That the King ſhould depoſite the Dutchy of <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> and himſelf that of <hi>Milan</hi> to be the price of the Victory. The third offer was, that if the King refuſed theſe two conditions, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared mortall War unto him, till one of the two was made the pooreſt gentleman of his Kingdom. The King purged himſelf to the Pope by letters of all the Emperours accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>The War grows hot in <hi>Piemont,</hi> an. 1536. Many exploits are done, <hi>Foſſan</hi> is beſieged by <hi>Antonio de Leva</hi> for the Emperour, and taken. The <hi>Marquis of Saluees</hi> leaves the Kings ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and turns to the Emperour, who enters into <hi>Provence,</hi> and beſiegeth <hi>Marſeille,</hi> but in vain, being defended by the Kings preſence, and by the generoſity of <hi>Ann de Montmorency,</hi> who ſince was Conſtable of <hi>France.</hi> The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour is beaten out of <hi>Provence.</hi> At the ſame time the Count of <hi>Naſſan</hi> makes ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:120113:92"/>in <hi>Picardy</hi> for the Emperour, takes <hi>Guiſe,</hi> beſiegeth <hi>Peronne,</hi> but is repulſed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Jean Capell</hi> the Kings Atturney General, moveth the Parliament that a <hi>proces</hi> be made againſt <hi>Charles</hi> as Felon, and Traitor againſt his Soveraign, of whom he held the Counties of <hi>Flanders, Artois,</hi> and <hi>Charolois,</hi> in fee. The Court of Peers hereupon aſſembled decree, that <hi>Charles</hi> ſhould be cited with ſound of Trumpet, upon the frontier of his States, to appear before them. And he not appearing, he was condemned, and his Dominions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending from the Crown were confiſcated. Preſently after, the King tooke many places in <hi>Artois.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1538. the <hi>Pope Paul</hi> the III. comes to <hi>Nice,</hi> where both the Emperour and the King met alſo; the Pope communing ſeparately with each of them, for hee could not obtaine of them that they ſhould ſee one another. Yet they concluded a truce for ten years. That meeting being ended, the King returnes into <hi>France,</hi> the Emperour into <hi>Spain,</hi> but ſeeth the King by the way at <hi>Acqueſmortes;</hi> They confirme the truce, and are civill one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Shortly after, the City of <hi>Ghent</hi> being revolted, and having killed their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, <hi>Charles</hi> deſireth <hi>Francis</hi> to give him paſſage through his Lands, which the King granted him. In that paſſage the Emperour
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:120113:92"/>received all the royall honours. The King went to meet him at <hi>Chaſtellerant.</hi> In that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview, the Emperour gave the King ſome hope to give him ſatisfaction about the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of <hi>Milan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>An.</hi> 1641. the King ſent <hi>Antony Rincot,</hi> a Spaniard that had taken ſanctuary in France, to the Turk, and <hi>Caeſar Fregoſa</hi> to the <hi>Venetians.</hi> Both were ſlain upon the River of <hi>Po,</hi> going to Venice by Boat. This murder was done by the order of the <hi>Marqueſs du Guaſt</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Milan,</hi> who hoped thereby to get their Papers and Inſtructions, but they had been ſent to <hi>Venice</hi> another way. The <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs</hi> was accuſed and convicted of the fact by thoſe that executed it, who were taken at <hi>Venice.</hi> Upon this the King breaks the truce of tens years. The Dolphin, who was ſince <hi>Henry</hi> the II, falls upon the <hi>Rouſſillon,</hi> beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Perpignan,</hi> but is repulſed with loſſe. <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> ſeizeth upon <hi>Lut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenburg.</hi> The Emperour on the other ſide makes a league with the King of <hi>England,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>Picardie,</hi> beſiegeth <hi>Landrecy,</hi> but <hi>Francis</hi> relieveth it, and driveth the Emperour from the ſiege: <hi>Barbaroſſa</hi> the Turk comes by Sea to the Kings help, takes the Town of <hi>Nice,</hi> waſteth thoſe coaſts of the Mediterranean ſea, goeth away having done little good to the French, and ill ſatisfied of them, having
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:120113:93"/>given a great matter of obloquy againſt <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> to the Chriſtian Princes.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Piemont,</hi> after many exploits on both ſides, the famous battel of <hi>Ceriſoles</hi> was fought <hi>an.</hi> 1544. and won by the French, the French Generall being the Duke of <hi>Anguien,</hi> the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> the <hi>Marqueſs du Guaſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At this time <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, brother to <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour, being ſore preſt by the Turk in <hi>Hungary,</hi> ſends a Dominican Fryer, his Confeſſor to <hi>Charles</hi> to exhort him to peace; <hi>Charles</hi> is perſwaded to it, and <hi>Francis</hi> alſo. Their Deputies meet at St. <hi>John des Vignes,</hi> in the Suburbs of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> and begin a Treaty which ſoon after was concluded at <hi>Creſpy</hi> in <hi>Valois,</hi> of which theſe were the chiefe conditions.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> the Kings ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Son, ſhould marry the Emperours Daughter, or that of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of the Romans, at the Emperours choice within ſix yeares; and for her portion, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour ſhould inveſt the ſaid Duke with the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> or the County of <hi>Flanders,</hi> or <hi>Charolois,</hi> or <hi>Franch County,</hi> at the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours choyce likewiſe. And that upon his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture with one of theſe, the King ſhould renounce all his claim to all the reſt, and to the Kingdom of Naples. That till there were Children born by that marriage, if the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour

                     <hi>Francis</hi> out-lived three years the Treaty of <hi>Creſpy,</hi> all which time he had no War with <hi>Charles,</hi> who had retired himſelf to <hi>Bruxelles.

                  <p n="1">1. The Pope, <hi>Paul</hi> the III. had inveſted his Baſtard, <hi>Peter Lewis, Farneſio,</hi> with the Towns of <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Placentia,</hi> which the Emperour had yieled to the Church upon the claime of <hi>Leo</hi> the X. without much examining the Popes right, onely becauſe it had been ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted when the Pope and the Emperour united themſelves to expell the French out of Italy, <hi>an.</hi> 1521. That inveſtiture troubled <hi>Charles</hi> afterwards, who pretended, either that theſe Towns ſhould remaine united to the patrimony of the Church, or that in caſe of alienation they ſhould return to the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of <hi>Milan.</hi> Now this <hi>Peter Lewis, Farne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio,</hi> having made himſelfe odious to his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, by his cruelty and impudicity, was ſlain by the people of <hi>Placentia,</hi> who put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the Emperours protection. At the ſame time <hi>Paul</hi> the III, being dead, <hi>Jules</hi> the III, that ſucceeded him, maintained at the firſt <hi>Octavio,</hi> Son to <hi>Peter Lewis,</hi> in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture of <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Placentia.</hi> But ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter repenting of that donation which he ſaw to be diſpleaſing to the Colledge of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, joyned with the Emperour for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſing of <hi>Octavio,</hi> who put himſelf in <hi>Henry</hi> the II, his protection; and that King power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully aſſiſted him both againſt the Pope and the Emperour, and was at ſuch odds with the Pope, as to prohibit the bringing of any
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:120113:94"/>money out of France to Rome. At which the Pope amazed, deſired peace of the King, and deſiſted to oppoſe <hi>Octavio,</hi> yea and cauſed the Emperour to reſtore <hi>Placentia</hi> to <hi>Octavio,</hi> ſince which time <hi>Octavio</hi> and his ſucceſſours have enjoyed <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Placentia.</hi> At the ſame time the King protected alſo the Prince of <hi>Miran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dola,</hi> whom the Pope would oppreſſe.</p>
                  <p>Before that time, <hi>an.</hi> 1545. the Emperour got a great victory over the Proteſtant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Germany.

                  <p>The Conſtable of <hi>Montmorency</hi> in his way ſeized upon the Townes of <hi>Metz, Toul,</hi> and <hi>Verdun,</hi> upon the Rights which we have ſet down in the third Chapter. That enterpize of <hi>Henry</hi> in favour of the Proteſtants, made the Emperour conclude a peace with them in haſte. So that the King being come to <hi>Stras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> was deſired by them to return, becauſe they were agreed with the Emperour. Retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from Germany, he took many Towns in <hi>Lutzenburg, Rochemars, Danvilliers, Ivoy, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villon.</hi> And the Emperour towards the end of the year 1551. beſiegeth <hi>Metz,</hi> ſo well

                  <p>The people of <hi>Siena</hi> fearing leſt that <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo de Medicis,</hi> Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> ſhould make himſelf Maſter of their Commonwealth, had put themſelves into the Emperours hands ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that he would bring them in their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But ſeeing that he would bring them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſubjection of <hi>Coſmo,</hi> they called <hi>Henry</hi> the II, to their help, who gave them <hi>Blaiſe de Montlue</hi> for their Governour, who ſince was Marſhal of France; in his Commentaries he hath deſcribed how that City was beſieged. But in the end they were forced to ſubmit to the <hi>Florentine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the year 1555. the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> reſigned the Imperial Crown to his brother <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and all his other Eſtates to his Son <hi>Philip</hi> the II.

                  <p>But preſently after the death of <hi>Jule</hi> the III. and the Pontificat of <hi>Marcel</hi> the II. which laſted but two and twenty dayes, the peace was broken upon the Election of <hi>Paul</hi> the IV. a Neapolitan of the houſe of <hi>Caraffa,</hi> allied to that of <hi>Melpha,</hi> which had alwayes been of

Many exploits of Arms were done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Rome.</hi> But, <hi>Octob.</hi> 14. 1557, the Pope and the Spaniard agreed, and <hi>Henry</hi> called his Army back.</p>
                  <p>But at the ſame time <hi>Philip</hi> having marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> made his wife declare War to <hi>Henry</hi> by a Heralt of Arms, who ſpoke to the King himſelf at <hi>Reims,</hi> whence followed many various effects of war in <hi>Picardie</hi> and <hi>Champagne,</hi> till the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable battell of <hi>Saint Guintin</hi> loſt by the French, an. 1557. where the Conſtable was taken.

                     <p>In this reign of ninteen months, the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obſerveth two notable things, which are much for our purpoſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The State of <hi>France</hi> being in trouble at the entry of this reign, by the great favour of the <hi>Guiſes,</hi> Unkles to Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> wife to <hi>Francis</hi> the II, and by the Queen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother <hi>Catherine de Medicis,</hi> who took the Regency of the Kingdome to the prejudice of <hi>Antony of Bourbon,</hi> King of <hi>Navarra,</hi> and firſt Prince of the blood of <hi>France</hi> after the Kings brothers, who being kept low, and all the houſe of <hi>Bourbon</hi> with him ſeemed to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>France</hi> of a Civil War. <hi>Philip</hi> the II con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that State of <hi>France,</hi> ſent to <hi>Francis</hi> the II a letter which was read in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, whereby he ſaid, that he had heard how ſome great men of <hi>France</hi> being ill ſatisfied of the Government eſtabliſht by him, his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in law <hi>Francis,</hi> threatned his State of a Civill War. That he <hi>Philip</hi> was ready to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:120113:97"/>all his Forces, and his life, to make him obeyed as his good confederate and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, remembring the good inſtructions, and the holy education which his Father <hi>Charles</hi> the V, had received from <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII, his Guardian.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The houſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> being degraded from the rank it ought to have had in the Court, <hi>Antony King of Navarra</hi> retired into <hi>Bearn;</hi> and when the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and the <hi>Prince de la Roche ſur Yon,</hi> conducted the Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> to her husband, he bore them company. Now becauſe by the Treaty of marriage, that Princeſſe was to be delivered to <hi>Philip</hi> upon the frontiers of <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>Duke de l' Infantaſqua,</hi> and the Cardinall of <hi>Burgos</hi> came to receive her in the Abbey of <hi>Roncevaux,</hi> which was in <hi>Navarra.</hi> There King <hi>Antony</hi> proteſted that the Queen was not delivered upon the frontires of <hi>Spain,</hi> but in the heart of his own Kingdom, that none ſhould believe hereafter that <hi>Roncevaux</hi> did belong to the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>

                     <p>All this reign paſt among civill confuſions about Religion, and ſcarce any diſpute was between the two Crowns. Yea <hi>Philip</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht <hi>Charles</hi> many times with Forces to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:120113:97"/>his Proteſtant ſubjects. Only theſe things are to be remembred for our purpoſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. After the firſt peace with the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, <hi>an.</hi> 1564, <hi>Charles</hi> made a progreſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Kingdom, and ſaw his ſiſter <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> at <hi>Bayonne.</hi> There the Queen-mother had an earneſt and ſecret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the Duke of <hi>Alba.</hi> It is thought they agreed about a mutuall aſſiſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Crowns, againſt the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Netherlands;</hi> for in that year 1565. they began to ſtir in thoſe Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Spaniard. <hi>Philip</hi> aſſiſted <hi>Charles</hi> with ſome Troops, which kindneſs <hi>Charles</hi> could not return, the fire being kindled in all the parts of his Kingdom.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>An.</hi> 1566. two things were near to have made a breach between the two States. <hi>Bertrand de Montlue,</hi> whom his Father in his Commentaries calleth, Captaine <hi>Peyrot,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peace in <hi>France,</hi> undertakes to make ſome conqueſt upon the Sea, comes to the Iſle of <hi>Madera,</hi> ſubject to <hi>Portugal,</hi> and deſiring to take water, is repulſed with Canon-ſhot, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he makes a deſcent into the Iland with ſtrong hand, beſiegeth the Town, takes it, but is ſlain in that exploit. A complaint is made of this to <hi>Philip,</hi> as Uncle to the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> as an infraction of the Treaty, in which <hi>Portugal</hi> was comprehended. <hi>Philip</hi>
                        <pb n="192" facs="tcp:120113:98"/>incenſeth <hi>Charles</hi> againſt his own ſubjects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this, but the Admiral appeaſeth <hi>Charles,</hi> ſhewing that it was but a miſ-underſtanding among private perſons.</p>
                     <p>Another buſineſſe of that nature was that of <hi>Gourgues. Dominique de Gourgues</hi> was a Captain of <hi>Gaſcony,</hi> who in the Wars of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> had been taken by the Spaniards, and ill u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in priſon. To be avenged of them, he went to <hi>Florida</hi> in the Weſt-Indies, beſieged the Fort which the Spaniards kept there, takes it by force, kills or hangs all the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, then returnes into France. Of this, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> makes high complaint unto <hi>Charles,</hi> and <hi>Gourgues</hi> was in great danger of his life; but he was protected by the Admirall of <hi>Chaſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> a Proteſtant, and an enemy to the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards. He repreſented unto the King, that it was an Act of private revenge. Alſo, that a little before <hi>Melander,</hi> a Spaniſh Captaine, had expelled out of the ſame Fort in <hi>Florida: John Rebaut</hi> of <hi>Diepe,</hi> with five hundred French-men, whom he had killed or hanged every man with this inſcription.</p>
                     <q>Not as to French-men, but as to Lutherans.</q>
                     <p>The wiſeſt French Hiſtorians affirm, and ſo did <hi>Gourgues</hi> himſelfe; That not any private revenge, but the deſire to puniſh that horrible
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:120113:98"/>treachery and murther upon his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, made him undertake and atchieve that high enterpriſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An.</hi> 1570. <hi>Charles</hi> married <hi>Elizabeth</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Emperour <hi>Maximilian,</hi> a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Princeſs, much beloved of her Husband. Shortly after <hi>Philip</hi> married another daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſame Emperour.

                     <p>In <hi>January,</hi> 1593. was the opening of the States of the <hi>League,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> extraordinary Embaſſador of <hi>Spain,</hi> declared his Maſters zeal for the defence of <hi>Religion,</hi> deſired them to chuſe a Catholique King, and to preſerve unto the <hi>Infanta</hi> of Spain, the right ſhe had to the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> Upon which that famous <hi>Arreſt</hi> or ſentence was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Parliament for the maintaining of the <hi>Salique</hi> Law.

                  <p>After the Treaty of <hi>Vervins,</hi> the two States kept reaſonable good intelligence. <hi>Philip</hi> the II. died in the time of the Treaty.</p>
                  <p>The firſt difference between <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> the III King of <hi>Spain,</hi> was about the <hi>Marqueſat of Saluces,</hi> which <hi>Henry</hi> redeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who did nothing but by the order of the Councell of <hi>Spain;</hi> And
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:120113:104"/>the Spaniard would not ſuffer the French to poſſeſſe any thing in <hi>Italy.</hi> An exchange then was made of <hi>Breſſe</hi> for the <hi>Marqueſat.</hi> Herein <hi>Philip</hi> did nothing againſt the alliance. For the <hi>Duke</hi> having broken his word with <hi>Henry, Philip</hi> refuſed to aſſiſt him, and to be a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of his perfidiouſneſſe, although the Count of <hi>Fuentes</hi> raiſed great forces to aſſiſt him.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1602. was the conſpiracy of the Duke of <hi>Biron.</hi> It was believed that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had a ſhare in his deſignes. But the depoſitions of the witneſſes againſt him, ſpeak only of Treaties and Intelligences with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and of the ſharing of the State of <hi>France</hi> among the conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours. Yet they ſaid that <hi>Biron</hi> ſhould have had the <hi>Dutchy of Burgundy, Franch County, and Breſſe</hi> under the protection of the King of <hi>Spain. Fontanelles</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Britain,</hi> who was convicted to have been one of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiratours, for which he was put to death, was accuſed to have treated with the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard to deliver the <hi>Ile</hi> of <hi>Triſtan</hi> in <hi>Britain</hi> into his hands. But <hi>Henry,</hi> who had no mind to break with Spaniard, would take no notice of that treachery.</p>
                  <p>The Spaniards pretence for theſe ſecret plots againſt <hi>France,</hi> was that <hi>Henry</hi> aſſiſted the Rebells of <hi>Holland</hi> with men and money. Which the Spaniſh Embaſſadour having
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:120113:104"/>complained of, he anſwered that the money which he ſent to the Hollanders was to pay his debts, for monies lent to him during the civil Wars.</p>
                  <p>As for the French Souldiers that ſerved the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> he could not hinder his ſubjects to take party where they liſted; and that ſome of them alſo ſerved the <hi>Archiduke.</hi> Howſoever that aſſiſtance was ſo reſented by the Spaniards, that they loſt no occaſion to ſtir diſorders in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many things hapned in the yeares 1605. and 1606. which ſhewed the enmity of the Spaniard againſt <hi>France.</hi> As the Treaſon of <hi>Loſte,</hi> Secretary to Mr. <hi>De Villeroy,</hi> who had intelligence with the Miniſters of <hi>Spain,</hi> and let them know all the ſecrets of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet Councell. He was diſcovered by one <hi>Raſſis</hi> a Frenchman, that had taken Sanctuary in <hi>Spain. Loſte</hi> ran away, and in his flight was drowned in the River of <hi>Marne,</hi> ſo no more could be known of that Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>Then the Lady <hi>Marqueſſe of Vernuiel</hi> ill ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of King <hi>Henry,</hi> whom ſhe accuſed to have broken his promiſe to her, treates with the Spaniard, and inveigleth into her treaſon her Father <hi>d' Antragues,</hi> and her brother the Count of <hi>Auvergne,</hi> ſince Duke of <hi>Angouleſm.</hi> Their deſign was to retire to the Spaniard, and to make one day that Ladies Son a ſtone
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:120113:105"/>of ſcandall unto <hi>France.</hi> Being diſcovered, all three were convicted and condemned to death. But the King gave them their grace.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1605. the reliques of <hi>Birons</hi> conſpiracy appeared in the Provinces of <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gort Limouſin and Quercy.</hi> All was done under the name of the Duke of <hi>Bovillon.</hi> Whether the Spaniard had a hand in it or no, it was not known.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time <hi>Mairargues</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Provence</hi> treated with the Spaniard to yeild <hi>Marſeille</hi> unto him. He was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and taken conferring with the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of the Spaniſh Embaſſadour, and put to death. This paſſage was near to have cauſed a breach between the two Crowns, for the Embaſſadour of <hi>Spain</hi> expoſtulated with the French King, becauſe againſt the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions his Secretary had been taken and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to priſon. The King juſtified the fact, ſaying, that he was found monopolizing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſthis State. Nevertheleſs all was ſuddenly appeaſed: Although at the ſame time another Treaſon was diſcovered, a plot upon <hi>Laucate</hi> by two brothers <hi>Luquiſſes,</hi> who had been won by the Governour of <hi>Perpignan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the year 1608. <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. mediated a truce between the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> At the ſame time the <hi>Moriſco</hi>'s of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:120113:105"/>
                     <hi>Spain</hi> ſecretly implored his aide againſt the oppreſſion of the Spaniards. But he ſent them back, ſaying, that he would not be the firſt that ſhould break peace, but that if he was compelled to make War, he might make uſe of their proffers.</p>

                  <p>A yeere before the Kings death an. 1609. <hi>John William Duke of Cleves and Juilliers</hi> being dead without iſſue left his ſucceſſion diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable betweene the Emperour <hi>Rodolphus</hi> who ſaid it was devolved to the Empire, and the children of foure ſiſters of that Duke married in the houſes of <hi>Brandenburg, Newburg, Deuxponts,</hi> and <hi>Burgan.</hi> It was thought that the great Army which Henry had prepared a little before his death was intended to aſſiſt theſe Princes againſt the Emperour. It ſeemes the <hi>Queene Regent</hi> knew ſo much, for when the <hi>Archiduke Leopold</hi> had ſeized upon <hi>Juilliers</hi> after the Kings death She ſent <hi>Marſhall de la Caſtre</hi> to aſſiſt theſe Princes, to whom he cauſed luilliers to be ſurrendred.

                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:120113:106"/>
                  <p>In the year 1612. the two Crownes were allied by the marriages, of <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIII. with <hi>Anne</hi> daughter to Philip the III, and of <hi>Philip</hi> Prince of <hi>Spaine</hi> (who is now <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> the IV) with <hi>Elizabeth</hi> eldeſt daughter of <hi>Henry the</hi> IV. And in the yeare 1615. theſe marriages were accompliſht at <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux.</hi> The world was full of hope that this double alliance would ſtrengthen the peace betweene the two Crownes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1616 the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Mantua</hi> being in War one againſt another about <hi>Montferrat,</hi> the Kings of France and Spain intervened to make them friends. And this was done without prejudice to the peace betweene the two States.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Valteline</hi> is a vally ſeated between <hi>Germany, the Venetians, the Dutchy of Milan, &amp; the Griſons.</hi> It was in old time a part of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> or at leaſt an appurtenance of the ſame. And was engaged to the <hi>Griſons</hi> by <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII. for foure hundred thouſand pounds arrear, due to them for their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the conqueſt of <hi>Milan,</hi> ſince which time it was ſubject to the <hi>Griſons.</hi> But the differences of Religion intervening and the Griſons being turned Proteſtants for the moſt part, <hi>Valtolina</hi> kept for the moſt part the Religion of <hi>Milan.</hi> Which made them deſire to ſhake the yoke of the <hi>Griſons</hi> and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:120113:106"/>returne under the ſubjection of <hi>Milan,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to it by the Spaniards. So that <hi>an.</hi> 1619. the great revolt began, and the <hi>Valtolins</hi> expell the <hi>Griſons</hi> their Maſters. Who had recourſe to the protection of <hi>France,</hi> by whom they held that Countrey. King <hi>Lewis the</hi> XIII. ſends <hi>Monſieur de Baſſompierre</hi> into Spaine to <hi>Philip the</hi> IV. (for <hi>Philip the</hi> III. was lately dead) who granted accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Treaty of Madrid</hi> that all garriſons of ſtrangers ſhould depart out of <hi>Valtolina,</hi> and that order ſhould be taken for the maintaining of the <hi>Catholique Religion. The Duke of Feria</hi> having refuſed to execute that command, and the <hi>Valtolins</hi> unwilling to returne to the obedience of the <hi>Griſons. King Lewis</hi> exhorted the <hi>Switzers and Griſons</hi> to maintaine their rights, and ſent them an Embaſſadour the <hi>Marquis de Coenures</hi> whom he made afterwards <hi>General of their army</hi> and <hi>Marſhall</hi> of France, known by the name of <hi>Marſhall d'Eſtree</hi> Then did the French and the Spaniards fight, yet without breaking the Treaty of <hi>Vervins</hi> becauſe both acted for their confederates.</p>
                  <p>Pope <hi>Vrban the</hi> VIII. having made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe Depoſitary of the principal places of <hi>Val olina,</hi> ſent his nephew <hi>Cardinal Barbarini</hi> into France <hi>an.</hi> 1625. who not being able to make an accommodation, as pretending
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:120113:107"/>to deliver <hi>Valtolina</hi> from the obedience of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> war began in Italie by the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance made betweene the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Duke of Savoy</hi> againſt <hi>Genoa</hi> which was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by the Spaniard. Thus theſe quarrels upon the by, came very neer to an abſolute rupture betweene the two Nations. For at the ſame time ſome Spaniſh ſhips paſſing from <hi>Barcetona to Genoa</hi> and driven upon the coaſts of <hi>Marſeille</hi> were arreſted by the <hi>Duke of Guiſe.</hi> Of which the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> complained to the King of Spaine, whoſe Councel irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated with theſe wars, and with the taking of many places about <hi>Genoa,</hi> gave order that all French ſhips in the havens of Spaine, ſhould be arreſted, and all the goods of the French trafficquing in Spaine, ſeized upon. The Councell of France to bee even with them made two <hi>Edicts;</hi> the one to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid all traffick with Spaine, the other to ſeize upon all ſhips of Spain, Portugal, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and other places of the Spaniſh domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; yet onely by right of repreſalls and for reſtitution of the goods taken from the French.</p>
                  <p>War continued in <hi>Piemont</hi> all that while, till the winter of that yeare 1625, when the armies retired into garriſons. That winter <hi>Du Fargis</hi> the French Emaſſadour in Spain began a Treaty which was called the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:120113:107"/>Treaty of <hi>Monſon in Arragon,</hi> whereby with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Commiſſion from his Maſter or his principall Miniſter of State the <hi>Cardinal de Richelieu</hi> (as it was pretended) he did great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly derogate to the right of the <hi>Griſons</hi> over <hi>Valtolina,</hi> making the <hi>Valtolins</hi> well nigh Soveraines, taking from the <hi>Griſons</hi> all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to refuſe the Iudges and that forme of Government which the <hi>Valtolins</hi> would ſet up among themſelves. That Treaty was diſavowed by <hi>King Lewis</hi> and the <hi>Cardinal</hi> who commanded the Embaſſadour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it. Wherein ſo much tedious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction was uſed, that <hi>Lewis</hi> was in the end conſtrained to take upon him the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the <hi>Valtolins,</hi> and ſent them the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Rohan</hi> who there continued the war, even after the rupture between the two Crownes.</p>
                  <p>In the yeare 1628 <hi>Vincent the</hi> II. <hi>Duke of Mantua</hi> being dead, <hi>Charles Duke of Nevers</hi> the next heire male ſucceeded; but the Emperour made ſome difficulty about it becauſe he was borne in France, and becauſe he did not come perſonally to him to render his homage. But beſides his right of lapſe for want of homage, he ſet up the right of <hi>Duke Guaſtullo</hi> of the ſame houſe of <hi>Mantua,</hi> which yet appeared at the firſt to be weake and of no force.</p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:120113:108"/>
                  <p>At the ſame time, the <hi>Duke of Savoy</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed his rights to <hi>Montferrat.</hi> So the new Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> ſaw himſelfe almoſt ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up by the Emperour, the Spaniard, and the Duke of Savoy. Yea <hi>Don Gonzales de Cordova</hi> beſieged <hi>Cazal,</hi> the old apple of diſcord between the houſes of <hi>Mantua and Savoy. King Lewis,</hi> reſolved to maintaine his ſubject and confederate, ſends <hi>Bevron</hi> and <hi>Guron</hi> to defend <hi>Cazal.</hi> Himſelfe paſſeth into <hi>Italie,</hi> forceth <hi>Le pas de Suze,</hi> driveth the Spaniard from the ſiege of <hi>Cazal,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelleth the <hi>Duke of Savoy</hi> to let the <hi>Mantuan</hi> be in peace.</p>
                  <p>The Proteſtants in France being in armes, <hi>Rochel</hi> beſieged, and their party brought low, ſome ſay that the <hi>Duke of Rohan</hi> ſent <hi>Clauſel</hi> from <hi>Montpellier</hi> to Madrid, to put the Proteſtant party under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the King of Spain. The Hiſtory of <hi>Dupleix</hi> ſets downe the whole Treaty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Duke of Rohan,</hi> whereby the Spaniard promiſeth to aſſiſt <hi>Rohan</hi> with men and money. But Lewis returning victorious out of Italie, ſuddenly overcame the Proteſtant party, and forced them to receive peace. The Spaniard thought he might as lawfully aſſiſt the Proteſtants of France, as the French aſſiſted thoſe of Holland.</p>

            <head>AN APPENDIX To the foregoing DISCOURSE; <hi>Shewing the Diſpute about the precedence at the Councell of Trent, betweene the Embaſſadors of</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Spaine.</head>
            <p>IT is certaine, that before the formation of that great <hi>Coloſſus</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> about the year 1520. the Kings of <hi>France</hi> were acknowledged the firſt of Chriſtendom next to the Emperours.</p>
            <p>The pieces wherewith the greatneſſe of <hi>Spain</hi> is made up, are Provinces moſt of them feudatary of the Empire, or of France, or of the Pope; all theſe lately gathered up. But France is of an ancient, entire, and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent greatneſſe.</p>
            <p>The Embaſſadours of <hi>Charles</hi> the V. had the precedence every where before thoſe of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:120113:110"/>
               <hi>France,</hi> becauſe he was Emperour. But in the year 1555. when he reſigned that quality of Emperour to his Brother, and his other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and ſtates to his Son, perceiving that his Son wanting the quality of Emperour, could not keep that preheminence, he uſed this artifice. A little before his retirement from the world, he recalled from <hi>Venice</hi> his Embaſſador, <hi>Franciſco de Vargas,</hi> who being an Embaſſador of the Empire, had a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence before the French Embaſſador. Then after the reſignation of his States, he ſent the ſame <hi>Vargas</hi> to <hi>Venice</hi> again, as Embaſſadour for himſelfe and his Son joyntly, although in effect <hi>Charles</hi> being deveſted of his dignities, <hi>Vargas</hi> was Embaſſadour of his Son onely, hoping thereby to deceive the <hi>Venetians</hi> and others, by ſending the ſame man. <hi>Vargas</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of the Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence which he had before. To which <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minique,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lodeva,</hi> Embaſſadour of <hi>Henry</hi> the II, of <hi>France,</hi> made oppoſition, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting to the Senate, that <hi>Charles</hi> was no more conſiderable in the world; that when the Embaſſadours of the Emperour <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> ſhould appear, he would yield to them; but that he would not yield to the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour of <hi>Philip,</hi> but in all occaſions of audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ceremony, viſits, and the like, he would take the firſt place, till the coming of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:120113:111"/>Embaſſadors. The Senate fearing ſome ill iſſue of this diſpute, gave order that the two Embaſſadours ſhould not preſent themſelves at the ceremonies of the Feaſt of St <hi>Mark;</hi> and ſo the matter remained unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided all the year 1557, by the irreſolution of that Common-wealth, and the ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the French Embaſſadour. But in the year 1558. <hi>Francis de Novailles,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Acs,</hi> having ſucceeded that of <hi>Lodeva,</hi> renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the diſpute, and the Embaſſadours of the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> being come, he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be maintained in his Rights, and to have the firſt place after the Emperours Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, and couragiouſly took it before <hi>Vargas;</hi> who ſeeing that the policy of <hi>Charles</hi> (who dyed at the ſame time) took no effect, and that he was confidered onely as Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour of <hi>Philip,</hi> began to extoll his Maſters greatneſs, and number his States and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignties which he poſſeſſed in farre greater number then the King of <hi>France.</hi> Saying that theſe cuſtoms of honour and precedence, muſt alter according to the time. That his Maſter was the greateſt King of the world; farre more able to aſſiſt the Common-wealth with Arms, Men, and Money, then the King of France. The Biſhop of <hi>Acs</hi> ſtoutly reſiſted him, and obtained of the Senate an Order whereby the precedence was adjudged unto
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:120113:111"/>him above the Embaſſadour of Spain. About which, when the Spaniard expoſtulated very earneſtly, it was anſwered him, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth would not undertake to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the greatneſſe of their Majeſties; but that they found in their Records, that in all Acts both publique and private, Ceremonies, Viſits, and Audiences, the Embaſſadours of France had preceded thoſe of Spain, and to that received cuſtome they would keep. This anſwer offended <hi>Philip,</hi> who upon that called back his Embaſſadour. But <hi>Micael Surriano,</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> Embaſſadour in his Court, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the decree of the Senate of <hi>Venice,</hi> and in ſome ſort mitigated the diſpleaſure of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> who yet in all occaſions renued that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.</p>
            <p>His greateſt effort was four years after in the Councill of <hi>Trent.</hi> To underſtand the right of precedences of Ambaſſadours, we muſt know, that in the Councill there was three ſorts of Aſſemblies; particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, generall Congregations, and Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. In the private Congregations, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors aſſiſted with ſome Biſhops, examined the queſtions of Faith and Reformation, and there no Ceremony of precedence was heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In the general Congregation all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates aſſembled, the Legats were Preſidents, every one kept his place of honour: It was a
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:120113:112"/>publique action where queſtions were reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the Legates propounded that which was to be examined in the particular Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; every Prelate had right to ſpeak and to vote; Embaſſadors of Princes had audience after their Commiſſion was examined, and that which was to be promulgated in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Seſſion was there concluded; Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors kept their place there according to their rank. The Seſſion was the ſolemne day, upon which after a Maſs of the Holy Ghoſt, and a Sermon of a Prelate, or ſome eminent man upon the matter in queſtion; the Prelate officiating, pronounced with a loud voyce the Decrees reſolved, which the Fathers appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with a <hi>Placet.</hi> In theſe Seſſions, Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors had alſo their place of honour, and at the Maſs: That honour was ſeen by the place where they ſate, by the <hi>Cenſer,</hi> and by the <hi>Pax,</hi> which was given them in the time of the Maſs. Now whereas this Councill was held at three ſeverall times, under there ſeveral Popes, <hi>Paul</hi> the III, <hi>Jule</hi> the III, and <hi>Pius</hi> the IV. In the time of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Jule, Charles</hi> the V, was Emperour, whoſe Embaſſadors with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradiction ſat above the French Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, who in the ſixteen firſt Seffions ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very little, and no place was held there under the title of <hi>Spain.</hi> Yet ſome things hapned then which ſhewed the eminency of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:120113:112"/>the French Kings above all others, next to the Emperour. In the Bull of the Indiction of the Councill <hi>Paul</hi> the III, dated <hi>an.</hi> 1542. the King of France is named after the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour in expreſs terms, and all the other Princes comprehended in one generall term, and that twice. Thus, <hi>Chariſſimos in Chriſto filios nostros, Carolum Romanorum Imperatorem, &amp; Chriſtianiſſimum Regem Franciſcum, duo prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipua Chriſtiani nomins firmamenta atque fulcra orare atque obſecrare inſtitimus.</hi> A little lower. <hi>Supra autem dictos, Imperatorem Regemque Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianiſſimum, nec non caeteros Reges, Duces, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes quorum praeſentia ſi aliàs unquam, hoc qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem tempore maximè, ſanctiſſimae Chriſti fidei &amp; Chriſtianorum futur a eſt ſalutaris, rogantes atque obſecrantes per viſcera miſericordiae Dei,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the Council, an. 1545. <hi>Francis</hi> the I, had appointed for his Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, <hi>Claude D'Urfé Seneſchal of Foreſts, Jac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques de Liguieres, Preſident in the third Chamber of Enqueſts in the Parliament of Paris, and the Deane, Peter Danes, ſince Biſhop de la Vaur.</hi> But being informed by ſome French Biſhops that were at <hi>Trent,</hi> that there was little hope that the Councell ſhould do any good, he called back his Embaſſadors who did not appear in the Councel. <hi>Antony Filioly</hi> of <hi>Ganat,</hi> Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Aix</hi> in <hi>Provence</hi> was there for the King who in the firſt Seſſion, when publike prayers
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:120113:113"/>were made for the Princes, having required that the King of France ſhould be named in expreſſe termes, as he had been named in the Bull of the Indiction, the Legats eluded that demand, and ſaid, that the Fathers ought to be conſulted about it, and none was pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for in expreſſe termes but the Pope and the Emperour; all other Princes were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in one generall term.</p>
            <p>In the year 1546. <hi>Francis</hi> the I, ſent his Embaſſadour <hi>Peter Danes,</hi> Biſhop <hi>de la Vaur</hi> to the Councill; At his reception, he made a fine ſpeech, wherein he repreſented the State of Chriſtendom, and the great diſorders crept into the Church, even into the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> At which when a certaine Biſhop did laugh, ſaying, <hi>Gallus Cantat. Danes</hi> replyed readily, <hi>Utinam iſto gallicinio, Petrus ad reſipiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiam &amp; fletum excitetur.</hi> An Apophthegm which afterwards was rife in the mouth of the Fathers of the Councill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> 1547. when <hi>Paul</hi> the III, to a void the plague &amp; the war of <hi>Germany,</hi> would remove the Councill from <hi>Trent</hi> to <hi>Bolonia;</hi> the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates conſulting the Fathers about it, ſaid that his Holineſſe approved of it, <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cato etiam conſilio cum Imperatore, Chriſtianiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo Rege, &amp; aliis Regibus ac principibus Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> which is another expreſſion of the honour which the Council did to the Kings of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="223" facs="tcp:120113:113"/>
            <p>But in the third Indiction of the Councill under <hi>Pius</hi> the IV. <hi>an.</hi> 1561, in the Bull of the Indiction, <hi>Pius</hi> the IV, uſeth other words then <hi>Paulus</hi> the III, and <hi>Julius</hi> the III, had u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before. Thus, <hi>Chariſſimos verò in Chriſto filios noſtros Romanorum Imperatorem electum, caeteroſque Reges, &amp; Principes quos optandum ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nè eſſet Concilio intereſſe poſſe, hortamur &amp; roga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> without any mention of the moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King. <hi>Philibert de la Bourdeſiere,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Angouleſm,</hi> Embaſſadour of <hi>France,</hi> in the Popes Court expoſtulated with him by the Kings order for that neglect, with proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that notwithſtanding that neglect, he would not hinder the progreſs of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill; yea, that he had commanded his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to go to the Councill. The Pope an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that he had charged ſome Cardinals to form the Bull, and that they had not heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>Pointillo;</hi> and that after they had na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Emperour, they had not judged it neceſſary to name all the Kings, but had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended them under one generall name. The Embaſſador replyed, that it was a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> not to be comprehended under a generall name. The Pope anſwered, that he could not foreſee all things, and that another time order ſhould be given, that the like errour ſhould not be committed.</p>
            <pb n="224" facs="tcp:120113:114"/>
            <p>In the year 1562, the 18. of <hi>May, Lewis de Saint Gelais, Lord de Lanſac,</hi> came to <hi>Trent,</hi> and three dayes after, <hi>Arnault Ferrier, Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Enqueſts of Paris, and Guy du Faur de Pibrac,</hi> chiefe Judge of <hi>Toloſa,</hi> ſent by the King of <hi>France,</hi> who were received with great honour by the Council; yea great part of the Prelats ſubjects of the King of Spain went to meet them. But <hi>Ferdinand de Avalo, Marqueſs of Pesquera,</hi> Embaſſadour to King <hi>Philip,</hi> went out of <hi>Trent</hi> three dayes before, and retired to <hi>Milan,</hi> of which he was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, pretending a feare from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of <hi>Daulphiné</hi> and the <hi>Switzers,</hi> but in effect to avoid meeting with the French Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, who took their place in the general Congregation after the Imperiall Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors. <hi>Pibrac</hi> made a fine Oration, wherein he ſpake very freely againſt the diſorders of the Church, the ſmall progreſs of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill in ſuch a long time, and for the liberty of voting in the Councill, which was not to be expected from <hi>Rome.</hi> He was ſeconded by the two other Embaſſadors, <hi>Lanſac</hi> and <hi>Ferrier.</hi> The Pope complained of it, and ſaid that the King of <hi>France</hi> had ſent not Embaſſadors, but Advocates of the <hi>Hugenots.</hi> And indeed the ill opinion which the Fathers of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill had of the beliefe of theſe three men was a cauſe why the Councill and the Pope dealt
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:120113:114"/>with them with more rigor. In the meane while the French Biſhops came to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill, conducted by the Cardinall of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> who was moſt honourably received by the Cardinall of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and the other Legates.</p>
            <p>Soon after the coming of the Cardinall of <hi>Lorrain, Philip</hi> the II, having called back the Marqueſſe of <hi>Peſquera,</hi> ſent to <hi>Trent</hi> another Embaſſador, <hi>Ferdinand Quigones, Count de Luna,</hi> who being gone to Germany before, to be preſent at the Coronation of <hi>Maximilian,</hi> Son to the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> would know of the Fathers of the Councill, what place they would give him. Upon which the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of <hi>Mantua,</hi> the firſt Legate, having conſulted with the Embaſſadours of <hi>France,</hi> and the Cardinall of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> he propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them this accommodation, that as for them they ſhould keep their place next to the Embaſſadors of the Emperour, and that ſome other place might be found for the <hi>Count of Luna,</hi> over againſt the Legates on the other ſide, or after the Eccleſiaſtical Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, or in ſome other place out of the bench of the Embaſſadors. To which the French anſwered, that they were ſent by their King not to judge cauſes, or to decide of the Rights of King <hi>Philip,</hi> who was a good friend &amp; brother in law to their King, <hi>Charles</hi> the IX: but if any would take their place,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:120113:115"/>they were reſolved to ſtand for it againſt all ſorts of perſons; which if the Councill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed them, they had order to withdraw with all the French Prelates, and to proteſt of the nullity of the reſolutions which ſhould be taken in their abſence. To which the <hi>Legate</hi> anſwered nothing. That declaration of the French, though generous, gave occaſion to the affront which ſoon after was offered to them in the Councill; for they are cenſured by poſterity, for not requiring abſolutely that the Spaniards ſhould ſit under them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> 1563. The Legates fearing ſome divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion between the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Doctors about their order in ſpeaking, gave order that without diſtinction of Nations, every one ſhould ſpeak according to his ſeniority of Doctorſhip. But becauſe ſome among the French Divines had the ſeniority over the Spaniſh; theſe made great complaints to the Legate, pretending that this preference of the French, would be a prejudice againſt the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute which the <hi>Count de Luna</hi> was forming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the French Embaſſadours. The Legats rebuked them, ſhewing that the Doctors, though ſent by the Princes, did not repreſent their perſons as the Embaſſadors did: and that the queſtion was onely of the ſeniority of the degree, not of the preference of the Nations. Notwithſtanding theſe ſatisfactory
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:120113:115"/>Reaſons, the Spaniards were angry, and threatned the Councill of their Kings diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, who ſhould take off his protection from them.</p>
            <p>The French ſeeing that the Spaniard ſtood upon points in ſuch a clear buſineſs, and that of Doctors they would make Embaſſadours, did obſtinate themſelves alſo to have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference even in the diſputes of the Divines. And becauſe the Popes delegates ſpake firſt without contradiction, the French asked to be admitted to ſpeak next after them, which the Legates were conſtrained to grant: and it was decreed, that after the <hi>Jeſuite Salmeron,</hi> the Popes Divine <hi>Nicolas Maillart</hi> Dean of the faculty of <hi>Paris,</hi> ſhould ſpeak; and that after that, all ſhould ſpeak according to the ſeniority of their degree, which was follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Yet to content the Spaniards, it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in the Regiſter of the Councill, that the French Doctor had ſpoken the firſt by the right of his ſeniority in the degree of Doctor, not by the preference of his Nation.</p>
            <p>The ſame year 1563. upon Eaſter-day, the <hi>Count of Luna</hi> was received at <hi>Trent,</hi> and in his entry mached between the Embaſſadors of the Emperour, and of France. This Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony paſt with much honour and civility between the two Nations. And at the ſame time, the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> writ to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:120113:116"/>perour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> (who was at <hi>Insprugh</hi> in the County of <hi>Tirol,</hi> three dayes journey from <hi>Trent</hi>) upon divers affaires of the Councill: and in the end of the Letter, deſired him to find ſome temper to lay down the diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the preference between the two Crowns, ſo that it might not appear in the Councill. But his Country-men blamed him for it, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he ought not to have taken notice of a diſpute ſo ill grounded: Or if he had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of it, it ſhould not have been to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired a temper, but to maintaine his Kings right. The Emperour anſwered him, that it belonged not to him to decide the diſputes between the Kings of France and Spain; but ſince he had deſired him to ſpeak his ſenſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, if your Embaſſadours (ſaid he) main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their rank after mine, and that none take that place from them; what does it import you what place be aſſigned unto the Spaniards? A verdict ill taken by the <hi>French,</hi> who held it to be of a dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. For in an order of ſitting, who ſo lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth his place (ſay they) is thought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe it, and to ask a higher, which cannot be done without moving a diſpute againſt thoſe that ſit in a higher ſeat.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Count of Luna</hi> after that ſolemn entry, was hidden forty dayes, and appeared not in any ceremony of publique action, being in
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:120113:116"/>great perplexity how to behave himſelf; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he had a mind to enter into the aſſembly in the midſt of the two Embaſſadors of the Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peror, who were injoyned to bear him compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and after they had taken their place, ſtand by them till his Commiſſion had been verified by the Councill, and then retire to his houſe. But conſidering that this would not be a generous maintaining of his Maſters honour, he made means that the <hi>French</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors ſhould be deſired not to appeare in the Aſſemby that day; which being denyed him, he ſent ſome Spaniſh Biſhops to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, to propound unto them, that the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Embaſſadors of Princes, ſhould not enter into the generall Congregations but the day of their reception, but ſhould content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be preſent at the Ceremony, the day of the Seſſion, maintaining that it had been ſo obſerved in the Councells before. But all the Embaſſadors of Princes having oppoſed that motion, he could obtain nothing. Again, he cauſed ſome Biſhops to propound ſome point to the Congregation, at the diſcuſſion whereof, the <hi>French</hi> ought not to be preſent as intereſſed parties; for example, to repreſent what damage would reſult to the whole Church by a peace of the King of <hi>France</hi> with the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> or ſome ſuch thing. But all that being rejected, and the Congregation being
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:120113:117"/>put off from day to day by his obſtinacy; in the end that the buſineſſes of the Councell might not be retarded: the Cardinall of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine,</hi> and the French Embaſſadors declared to the <hi>Legates,</hi> that if they might keep their place immediately after the Emperours Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, they did not care what place the Embaſſador of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould take.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> to this day exclaim againſt that action of the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, ſaying that it was a great weakneſſe, and that they had betrayed their Maſters ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Yea, the Fathers of the Councell diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked it. And when the <hi>Cardinal de la Bourde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere,</hi> Reſident for the King of France by the Pope, complained to him of that Spaniſh ambition, and novelty introduced againſt all ancient orders: the Pope (it was <hi>Pius</hi> the IV.) anſwered, that he ſhould complaine to the French Embaſſadors, whoſe weakneſs he condemned, ſaying, that although he had been ſolicited before and after the entry of <hi>Count de Luna</hi> into <hi>Trent,</hi> to favour that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne he had remained conſtant and inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and that he wondred how the French had ſo eaſily, yea ſo freely yielded.</p>
            <p>The day of the Congregation being come, and each Embaſſador having taken his place, the <hi>Count of Luna</hi> enters, ſtands over againſt the Legates, ſome what far from the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:120113:117"/>ſeat, preſents his Orders, and declares his Maſters will. Then he proteſted, that although the firſt ſeat was due to him next to the imperiall Embaſſadors, as repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greateſt Prince of Chriſtendome, the greateſt Prop of the Courch &amp;c. yet that he ſhould bring no confuſion to the affaires of the Councell, he deſiſted from that right; upon condition that this his proteſtation ſhould be inſerted into the Acts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell; ſo that they could not be printed, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe publiſht without it; and that a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſigned by the Legates ſhould be given him by the Secretary of the Councill. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſaid theſe words, he went to take his place appointed for him, near the Table of the Secretary of the Councell.</p>
            <p>The French Ambaſſadors ſitting by the Imperial, anſwered, that if it was thought that the place where they ſat was not the moſt honourable next to that of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, as it had been acknowledged in all the Councell before, the laſt of which were that of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and that of <hi>Lateran,</hi> under <hi>Leo</hi> the X; Or if the place aſſigned to <hi>Count de Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> might be a prejudice againſt them, they deſired the Councell to prevent it ſpeedily by orders, commands, excommunications, or other wayes, practiſed in ſuch a caſe without acception of perſons. But becauſe none an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:120113:118"/>any thing, and the Imperial Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors connived to that novelty (although their intereſſe was to hinder it, leaſt their place ſhould be once diſputed) they added: That without injury to the honour of King <hi>Philip,</hi> and the alliance betweene the two Crowns, they proteſted againſt that proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as unjuſt, requiring that their proteſtation ſhould be inſerted in the Acts of the Council, and that a Copy of the ſame ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto them.</p>
            <p>None of the Fathers ſpake one word upon theſe diſputes. And the ſilence was broken by a Spaniſh Doctor called <hi>Frontidon,</hi> who made a Latin Oration in the name of <hi>Count de Luna,</hi> whereby he exalted the greatneſſe of the King of Spain, his zeal towards the Church and Religion, with ſuch impertinent words, &amp; ſo much contempt of other Princes, that the Embaſſadors of the Emperour made great complaints about it to <hi>Count de Luna,</hi> who had no other ſhift to excuſe it, than ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Oration had diſpleaſed him more then any.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Promoter</hi> of the Councell having an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Oration, ſuddenly the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of Spain went out of the Aſſembly, not expecting the riſing of the Legates, to avoid a diſpute with the French, and the ſame he obſerved in the following Congregations,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:120113:118"/>ſitting by himſelf and going out alone.</p>
            <p>But that Order could not be kept in the Church the day of the Seſſion, becauſe the manner of ſitting there was not alike, and ſome more preciſe ceremonies were uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the preference, as that of the <hi>pax,</hi> and the <hi>cenſer</hi> at the Maſſe. Wherefore the <hi>Legats</hi> conſulted the <hi>Pope</hi> before the Seſſion, and he being won by the Spaniards, thinking that the French would again run into another weakneſſe, writ to the <hi>Legate</hi> that in the Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they ſhould aſſign a place apart to the Spaniard, and that the <hi>pax</hi> and the <hi>cenſer</hi> ſhould be given to both the Ambaſſadours at the ſame time; but that the buſineſſe ſhould be kept ſecret till the point of the action, that the French might not ſtorm at it.</p>
            <p>The day of the Seſſion being come, which was Saint <hi>Peters</hi> day, the 29. of <hi>June,</hi> after the Biſhop of <hi>Valdaoſta</hi> in <hi>Savoy</hi> had begun the Maſſe of the Holy Ghoſt, preſently a Chair of black Velvet was brought out of the Veſtry, which was placed between the laſt Cardinall and the firſt Patriarck, where <hi>Count de Luna</hi> ſate. The <hi>Cardinall of Lorrain</hi> with the French Ambaſſadours, made a great noiſe about it, and roſe to withdraw, when at the ſame time they heard the order given about it, and for the <hi>Cenſer</hi> &amp; the <hi>Pax.</hi> But for fear of troubling the action, they contented
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:120113:119"/>themſelves to proteſt againſt it, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that their Maſters right did not conſiſt in the equality, but in the precedence. The Goſpell being read whilſt a Divine went up into the Pulpit to make a ſpeech, the Legats with the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and the other Cardinalls, the Ambaſſadour of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and <hi>Ferrier</hi> one of the French Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours went into the Veſtry; into which they called the Archbiſhop of <hi>Granada,</hi> a Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, and two French Biſhops to find ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation. After many diſputes, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny goings and commings and meſſages to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> it was concluded that the Maſſe ſhould be ended without receiving the <hi>Cenſer</hi> and the <hi>pax.</hi> After which, <hi>Luna</hi> came out of the Church with his Spaniards triumphing for that firſt ſtep ſo advantagious to his Maſter.</p>
            <p>This action was very ſcandalous to the French; and the Legats not able to bear the envy of it, were conſtrained to produce the command which they had from <hi>Rome</hi> about it. The injury was more reſented, becauſe it was done to a King in his minority (it was <hi>Charles</hi> the IX) and one that was afflicted with Hugonots, and entangled in a civill War. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> writ very ſmart letters to the Pope about it; yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out violating the reſpect due to him. But <hi>Ferrier</hi> a violent and ſtout man, cryed out e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:120113:119"/>where, that unleſſe at the next publique Maſs the preference of the <hi>Cenſer</hi> and the <hi>Pax</hi> was given to his Maſter he would proteſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud, not againſt the Legats, who had obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Popes Orders, nor againſt the Councel, whoſe hands were manifeſtly bound, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt King <hi>Philip,</hi> who took his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage where he might, nor againſt the Roman Church, toward which he ſhould never loſe the due reſpect, but againſt the very perſon of the Pope, whom he would prove to have bought the pontificat, and would appeal from him to a lawfull Pope, and to a true and free Councel. And that his Maſter would cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate a Nationall Councel, as numerous and as Generall at that of <hi>Trent.</hi> It is certain that <hi>Ferrier</hi> &amp; <hi>Pibrac</hi> (for Lanſac was returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France</hi>) had prepared a moſt bloody ſpeech againſt the Pope, and againſt that innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Ferrier</hi> was to pronounce it, and at the ſame time command all the French Biſhops and Doctors to leave the Councell, with a promiſe to return whenſoever God had given a lawfull Pope to his Church, and reſtored to the Councels their antient and full liberty. The ſpeech was printed, but not pronounced. <hi>Ferrier</hi> ſpread it among the Fathers, becauſe <hi>Count de Luna</hi> boaſted that the Legats had promiſt him that at the firſt Maſs hee ſhould be admitted to the equality of the <hi>Pax</hi> and <hi>Cenſer.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="236" facs="tcp:120113:120"/>
            <p>The Legates fearing, leſt this quarrell ſhould come to ſome ſad iſſue, becauſe the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Poland</hi> declared, that if the King of <hi>France</hi> ſhould depart from the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Councel, the King of <hi>Poland</hi> would ſoon do the like, and many other Princes; The Legates I ſay, and the wiſeſt of the Council, eſpecially <hi>Madruvio, Cardinal of Trent,</hi> of the Imperial party, thought it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient that thereafter publique Maſſes ſhould be ſaid without the <hi>Pax</hi> and the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer,</hi> and made <hi>Count de Luna</hi> approve of it. And the King of <hi>Spain</hi> hearing all this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, thought he had got a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. But the Pope loſt by it, for the affront done to the French in that Councel hindred the publication of it in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shortly after, the <hi>Cardinal of Lorrain</hi> retired to <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Ferrier</hi> declaimed in a general Congregation againſt abuſes and diſorders crept into the Church, and ſpared no body. The Pope was much diſpleaſed at it, and to allay that heat, ſent the <hi>Cardinal of Lorrain</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> with full authority to regulate all with the Legats. He was preſent at the 24th Seſſion held <hi>November</hi> 11. 1563. which is of the Sacrament of marriage. And having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived order from <hi>France</hi> to return without delay with all the French Biſhops, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates haſted to make an end of the Councel,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:120113:120"/>and held the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Seſſion which was the laſt upon the 3d. and 4th. of <hi>December,</hi> in which Seſſion, as in the precedent, the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours kept their place. <hi>Luna</hi> ſate by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of the Councel. In the publique Maſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es neither <hi>Pax</hi> nor <hi>Cenſer</hi> was uſed. So the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ended the 4th. of <hi>Decem.</hi> 15 63. &amp; the <hi>Cardinal Moron,</hi> at that time the firſt Preſident, giving his bleſsing to the Fathers, told them <hi>Poſt gratias Deo actas Reverendiſſimi Patres, Ite in pace.</hi> And all anſwered, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But becauſe it was the cuſtom at the end of the Council, to make acclamations to bleſs the Popes that had aſſembled it, the Fathers that had held it, and the Princes that had aſsiſted it, and protected the Church; the Cardinall of <hi>Lorrain</hi> took himſelf the care to make them, and to pronounce them alſo; Which he was blamed for, as taking upon him that care which leſs becoming his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, and more fitting for Deacons, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motors, Secretaries, and Maſters of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. Eſpecially he was blamed becauſe in the acclamation made for the ſecular Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he forgot to name expreſly the King of <hi>France,</hi> which had been obſerved in the Bull of the Indiction, as we ſaid before, and the omiſſion whereof in the calling again of the Council by <hi>Pius the</hi> IV, had cauſed ſo much diſcontent and expoſtulation. Of this the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:120113:121"/>Cardinal could not be ignorant, nor pretend forgetfullneſſe; ſince thoſe acclamations were meditated and written down.</p>
            <p>There was two acclamations, the firſt for the memory of the dead, in which the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal forgot to expreſſe the names of <hi>Francis the</hi> I. <hi>and Henry the</hi> II, who had contributed their care and their zeal for the good of the Council. The ſecond was for the Princes li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, where he forgat <hi>Charles the</hi> IX, who had ſent his Ambaſſadours &amp; his Biſhops to <hi>Trent.</hi> So he forgot both the dead and the living. That omiſſion was objected to the Cardinal in the Kings Councel. He excuſed himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fear he had to make a diviſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Crowns, King <hi>Charles</hi> being yet in minority, in danger of a civil War, and of the diſorder which <hi>Germany</hi> was fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to upon the quarrell of Religion; Whereby the King might have need of <hi>Philip,</hi> whom therefore he would not provoke or incenſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus that weakneſs which the Cardinal and the French Ambaſſadours ſhewed in the Congregations, Seſsions, and Acclamations, having not with vigour enough defended the right of their Maſters, was defended by them with plauſible reaſons; but, in effect, they opened the gate to the pretences which the Spaniards form at every meeting of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:120113:121"/>Aſſemblies, Proceſsions, and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, againſt the French Ambaſſadours, who hitherto have ſtoutly defended their right. At leaſt they have kept the two eſſential points of precedence, which are; firſt, never to have left their place, either ſecond, when the Ambaſſadours of the Pope and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour were preſent, or firſt, when they were abſent. The other, never to have ſuffered or done any action which may be interpreted to give an equality to the Spaniard with them. As for the order of ſitting, which ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the Spaniard to ſit under the French; one can not take him by the hand to bring him to an Aſſembly when he pretends ſickneſſe or buſineſſe. But if he appear in a publique meeting, the French ſuffers him not to uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny action either of preference or equality.</p>
            <p>Since the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous meeting of the two Kings in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of their Ambaſſadours, or rather the only, was that of <hi>Vervins,</hi> an. 1598. where the French had the precedence, as we ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before.</p>
